adler | We experience reality always through the meaning we give it; not in itself, but as something interpreted. | Preface and Introduction
adler | In this way we can obtain a scientific 'meaning of life', a common measure of true meanings, a meaning which enables us to meet reality in so far as it concerns mankind. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Every human being has three main ties; and it is of these ties that he must take account. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Human beings live in the realm of meanings. | Preface and Introduction
adler | We do not experience pure circumstances; we always experience circumstances in their significance for men. | Preface and Introduction
adler | If a man should try to escape meanings and devote himself only to circumstances he would be very unfortunate: he would isolate himself from others: his actions would be useless to himself or to any one; in a word, they would be meaningless. | Preface and Introduction
adler | But no human being can escape meanings. | Preface and Introduction
adler | The realm of meanings is the realm of mistakes. | Preface and Introduction
adler | If we close our ears to his words and observe his actions, we shall find that he has his own individual 'meaning of life' and that all his postures, attitudes, movements, expressions, mannerisms, ambitions, habits and character traits accord with this meaning. | Preface and Introduction
adler | In all his actions there is an implicit reckoning up of the world and of himself; a verdict, 'I am like this and the universe is like that'; a meaning given to himself and a meaning given to life. | Preface and Introduction
adler | There are as many meanings given to life as there are human beings, and, as we have suggested, perhaps each meaning involves more or less of a mistake. | Preface and Introduction
adler | No one possesses the absolute meaning of life, and we may say that any meaning which is at all serviceable cannot be called absolutely wrong. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Here again we must remember that 'true' means true for mankind, true for the purposes and aims of human beings. | Preface and Introduction
adler | There is no other truth than this; and if another truth existed, it could never concern us; we could never know it; it would be meaningless. | Preface and Introduction
adler | He must always answer these problems because they are always questioning him; and the answers will show us his individual conception of the meaning of life. | Preface and Introduction
adler | In body and mind alike we must develop so that we can continue our personal lives on earth and help to insure the future continuance of mankind. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Whatever we do, our actions are our own answer to the situation of human life: they reveal what we think necessary, and fitting, and possible, and desirable. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Now if we take account of the weakness of the human body and the insecurity in which we are placed, we can see that for our own lives and for the welfare of mankind we must take pains to consolidate our answers, to make them far-seeing and coherent. | Preface and Introduction
adler | We must struggle always to find a better answer, and the answer must always be directly applicable to the fact that we are tied to the crust of this poor planet, earth, with all the advantages and disadvantages which our position brings. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Through war and peace; through rags and riches; through stories of hope and of despair; through tragedies and failure that end in triumph and success— The lessons are simple, as simple are the values that originate them: Courage, Perseverance, Faith, Love, Truthfulness, Decision, Good Stewardship, Happiness— | Preface and Introduction
adler | Positive thinking attracts positive things. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Even at its source our experience is qualified by our human purposes. | Preface and Introduction
adler | It will be natural to suppose, therefore, that this meaning is always more or less unfinished, incomplete; and even that it is never altogether right. | Preface and Introduction
adler | It is in his actions that every man inevitably puts the question and answers it. | Preface and Introduction
adler | He behaves as if he could rely upon a certain interpretation of life. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Among these varieties, however, we can distinguish some which answer better and some which answer worse; some where the mistake is small and some where it is large. | Preface and Introduction
adler | We can discover what it is that the better meanings share in common, what it is that the worse meanings lack. | Preface and Introduction
adler | They make up reality for him. | Preface and Introduction
adler | All the problems which confront him are in the direction of these ties. | Preface and Introduction
adler | The first of these ties is that we are living on the crust of this poor planet, earth, and nowhere else. | Preface and Introduction
adler | We must develop under the restrictions and with the possibilities which our place of habitation sets us. | Preface and Introduction
adler | This is one problem which challenges every man for an answer; which no individual can escape. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Every answer must be conditioned by the fact that we belong to mankind and that men are beings who inhabit this earth. | Preface and Introduction
adler | We cannot work haphazard or by guesswork, but we must work consistently, using all the means at our disposal. | Preface and Introduction
adler | We shall not find an absolutely perfect answer, an answer established once for all; but, nevertheless, we must use all our ability to find an approximate answer. | Preface and Introduction
adler | The author is considered a forward thinker and was way ahead of its time. | Preface and Introduction
adler | For thousands of years, life has been teaching us the same lessons over and over. | Preface and Introduction
adler | 'As a man thinks, so is his life', says the Bible. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Fear, Worry and Hate attract more fear, more worry and more hate, in all its manifestations. | Preface and Introduction
adler | But we just keep ignoring them, and making the same mistakes— | Preface and Introduction
adler | In this series, we present you the men and women of New Thought, whose lives were committed to enlighten the world with the wisdom of the ages. | Preface and Introduction
adler | These books are books for enlightenment... They will provide the seeker —the one who is ready and is paying attention-, some of the deepest answers of life. | Preface and Introduction
adler | 'Wood' means 'wood in its relation to mankind', and 'stone' means 'stone as it can be a factor in human life.' | Preface and Introduction
adler | It is true that the question is as old as human history and that in our own time young people — and older people as well — will often break out with the cry, 'But what is life for? What does life mean?' | Preface and Introduction
adler | We can say, however, that they ask only when they have suffered a defeat. | Preface and Introduction
adler | All meanings are varieties between these two limits. | Preface and Introduction
adler | However, please remember that this book is a product of its time and do not reflect the same views on race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and interpersonal relations as it would if it was written today. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Also, be extremely careful with what you think and how you think it. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Like attracts like. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Countless sages of the ages have tried to convey these messages and lessons in different ways and formulas. | Preface and Introduction
adler | William Walker Atkinson, Orison Swett Marden, Napoleon Hill, Dale Carnegie, Charles A. Haanel, Dale Carnegie, Wallace Wattles, Bruce Maclelland, Christian D Larson, Ernest Holmes, Ralph Waldo Trine, Elizabeth Towne, Henry Wood, Neville Goddard, Charles Fillmore, Emile Coué and a few others that we feature in our collection, are considered the masters of self-development and positive thinking, and the promoters of New Thought, a movement that came very much to life again with the Millennium. | Preface and Introduction
adler | If we asked a man, 'What is the meaning of life?', he would perhaps be unable to answer. | Preface and Introduction
adler | For the most part people do not bother themselves with the question or try to formulate replies. | Preface and Introduction
adler | So long as everything is plain sailing and no difficult tests are set before them the question is never put into words. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Most references to 'Man' must be read understanding 'Man' as human being, both male and female, as the author intended from the beginning. | Preface and Introduction
adler | King Solomon says in Proverbs that there is nothing new under the sun. | Preface and Introduction
adler | In over 300 books these writers brilliantly captured the essence of life, success, and the traditions of the East, becoming one of the best collections in personal and mind-development in existence. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Although the wisdom they impart is ageless, parents might wish to discuss with their children how some things have changed since this book was written. | Preface and Introduction
adler | No experience is a cause of success or failure. | The Meaning of Life
adler | We are self-determined by the meaning we give to our experiences. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Meanings are not determined by situations, but we determine ourselves by the meanings we give to situations. | The Meaning of Life
adler | By the end of the fifth year of life a child has reached a unified and crystallized pattern of behavior, its own style of approach to problems and tasks. | The Meaning of Life
adler | From now on, the world is seen through a stable scheme of apperception: experiences are interpreted before they are accepted, and the interpretation always accords with the original meaning given to life. | The Meaning of Life
adler | We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences — the so-called trauma — but we make out of them just what suits our purposes. | The Meaning of Life
adler | It has already fixed its deepest and most lasting conception of what to expect from the world and from itself. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Mistakes in the meaning given to life can be corrected only by reconsidering the situation in which the faulty interpretation was made, recognizing the error and revising the scheme of apperception. | The Meaning of Life
adler | First we must take children with imperfect organs, suffering from diseases or infirmities during their infancy. Such children are overburdened, and it will be difficult for them to feel that the meaning of life is contribution. | The Meaning of Life
adler | No imperfection of organs compels a mistaken style of life. | The Meaning of Life
adler | These three situations—imperfect organs, pampering, and neglect—are a great challenge to give a mistaken meaning to life; and children from these situations will almost always need help in revising their approach to problems. | The Meaning of Life
adler | The greatest of all helps, however, in gaining a quick comprehension of the meaning an individual gives to himself and to life comes through his memories. | The Meaning of Life
adler | From the first days of childhood we can see dark gropings after this 'meaning of life.' | The Meaning of Life
adler | Even if this meaning is very gravely mistaken, even if the approach to our problems and tasks brings us continually into misfortunes and agonies, it is never easily relinquished. | The Meaning of Life
adler | For the most part the approach can best be revised with the assistance of someone trained in the understanding of these meanings, who can join in discovering the original error and help to suggest a more appropriate meaning. | The Meaning of Life
adler | There are, however, certain situations in childhood from which a gravely mistaken meaning is very frequently drawn. | The Meaning of Life
adler | It is from children in these situations that the majority of failures come. | The Meaning of Life
adler | These are all circumstances in which they may turn in upon themselves, lose hope of playing a useful part in our common life, and consider themselves personally humiliated by the world. | The Meaning of Life
adler | It is mainly from those people who struggled hard against difficulties, in body as in outer circumstances, that advances and new contributions have come. | The Meaning of Life
adler | From the body we cannot judge whether the development of the mind will be bad or good. | The Meaning of Life
adler | The second type of situation which often provides the occasion for a mistake in the meaning given to life is the situation of the pampered child. | The Meaning of Life
adler | His interest was devoted to himself and he never learned the use and the necessity of cooperation. | The Meaning of Life
adler | These grown-up pampered children are perhaps the most dangerous class in our community. | The Meaning of Life
adler | This is the reason why punishments are always ineffective; they can do nothing but confirm the opinion, 'Others are against me.' | The Meaning of Life
adler | The third situation in which a mistake can easily be made is the situation of a neglected child. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Such a child has never known what love and cooperation can be: he makes up an interpretation of life which does not include these friendly forces. | The Meaning of Life
adler | There is really no experience which can take the place of disinterested affection. | The Meaning of Life
adler | The first task of a mother is to give her child the experience of a trustworthy other person: later she must widen and enlarge this feeling of trust until it includes the rest of the child's environment. | The Meaning of Life
adler | If she has failed in the first task—to gain the child's interest, affection and cooperation—it will be very difficult for the child to develop social interest and comradely feeling towards his fellows. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Everybody has the capacity to be interested in others; but this capacity must be trained and exercised or its development will be frustrated. | The Meaning of Life
adler | They must be helped to a better meaning. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Even a baby is striving to make an estimate of its own powers and its share in the whole life which surrounds it. | The Meaning of Life
adler | He will never do it, however, without some social pressure, or without finding that if he proceeds with the old approach he is at the end of his tether. | The Meaning of Life
adler | There is probably something of a mistake always involved when we take particular experiences as the basis for our future life. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Unless there is someone near them who can draw their attention away from themselves and interest them in others, they are likely to occupy themselves mainly with their own sensations. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Later on, they may become discouraged by comparing themselves with those around them, and it may even happen, in our present civilization, that their feelings of inferiority are stressed by the pity, ridicule or avoidance of their fellows. | The Meaning of Life
adler | We can often see children who overcome these difficulties and who, in overcoming them, develop unusual faculties for usefulness. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Many of the most eminent men, men who made great contributions to our culture, began with imperfect organs; often their health was poor and sometimes they died early. | The Meaning of Life
adler | The struggle strengthened them and they went further ahead. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Hitherto, however, the greatest part of children who started with imperfect organs and imperfect glands have not been trained in the right direction; their difficulties have not been understood and they have mainly become interested in their own persons. | The Meaning of Life
adler | It is for this reason that we find such a great number of failures amongst those children whose early years were burdened with imperfect organs. | The Meaning of Life
adler | The pampered child is trained to expect that his wishes will be treated as laws. | The Meaning of Life
adler | He is granted prominence without working to deserve it and he will generally come to feel this prominence as a birthright. | The Meaning of Life
adler | In consequence, when he comes into circumstances where he is not the center of attention and where other people do not make it their chief aim to consider his feelings, he will be very much at a loss: he will feel that his world has failed him. | The Meaning of Life
adler | He has been trained to expect and not to give. | The Meaning of Life
adler | He has never learned any other way of facing problems. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Others have been so subservient to him that he has lost his independence and does not know that he can do things for himself. | The Meaning of Life
adler | When he has difficulties before him, he has only one method of meeting them — to make demands on other people. | The Meaning of Life
adler | They are on strike against cooperating, as ordinary human beings, in our ordinary human tasks. | The Meaning of Life
adler | They consider society as hostile to themselves and try to revenge themselves upon all their fellows. | The Meaning of Life
adler | If society shows hostility to their way of living (as it almost undoubtedly will) they take this hostility as a new proof that they are personally ill-treated. | The Meaning of Life
adler | It will be understood that when he faces the problems of life he will overrate their difficulty and underrate his own capacity to meet them with the aid and good will of others. | The Meaning of Life
adler | He has found society cold to him and he will expect it always to be cold. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Especially he will not see that he can win affection and esteem by actions which are useful to others. | The Meaning of Life
adler | He will thus be suspicious of others and unable to trust himself. | The Meaning of Life
adler | It is a very sad comment on our civilization that so many failures in life come from those children who were orphans or illegitimate; and that we must group such children, on the whole, amongst the neglected children. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Every memory, however trivial he may think it, represents to him something memorable. | The Meaning of Life
adler | It is memorable because of its bearing on life as he pictures it; it says to him, 'This is what you must expect', or 'This is what you must avoid', or 'Such is life!' | The Meaning of Life
adler | In rare circumstances, perhaps, an individual may be forced by the consequences of a mistaken approach to revise the meaning he has given to life and may succeed in accomplishing the change by himself. | The Meaning of Life
adler | We never find two children whose glands have the same effects on them. | The Meaning of Life
adler | In this way Individual Psychology is not a very good advertisement for schemes of eugenic selection. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Some of them may make great protestations of good will; they may even become very 'lovable' in order to secure an opportunity to tyrannize. | The Meaning of Life
adler | There are others who are in more open revolt: when they no longer find the easy warmth and subordination to which they were accustomed, they feel betrayed. | The Meaning of Life
adler | I was the first person, I think, to describe the difficulties that confront a child whose organs are imperfect or whose glandular secretions are abnormal. | The Meaning of Life
adler | In Individual Psychology, however, we are considering the psyche itself, the unified mind; we are examining the meaning which individuals give to the world and to themselves, their goals, the direction of their strivings, and the approaches they make to the problems of life. | Mind and Body
adler | We must never treat a Symptom or a single expression: we must discover the mistake made in the whole style of life, in the way the mind has interpreted its experiences, in the meaning it has given to life, and in the actions with which it has answered the impressions received from the body and from the environment. | Mind and Body
adler | Styles of life are the proper subject-matter of psychology and the material for investigation; and schools which take any other subject-matter are occupied, in the main part, with physiology or biology. | Mind and Body
adler | This is the real task of psychology. | Mind and Body
adler | The best key which we so far possess for understanding psychological differences is given by examining the degree of ability to cooperate. | Mind and Body
adler | We must recognize the specific discouragement which he shows in his style of life; we must encourage him at the precise point where he falls short in courage. | Mind and Body
adler | The inferiority complex appears before a problem for which an individual is not properly adapted or equipped, and expresses his conviction that he is unable to solve it. | Mind and Body
adler | The 'inferiority complex', one of the most important discoveries of Individual Psychology, seems to have become world-famous. | Mind and Body
adler | It never helps us, for example, to tell a patient that he is suffering from an inferiority complex; to do so would only stress his feelings of inferiority with but showing him how to overcome them. | Mind and Body
adler | No neurotic is distinguished from other neurotics by the fact that he has an inferiority complex and the others have none. He is distinguished from the others by the kind of situation in which he feels unable to continue on the useful side of life; by the limits he has put to his strivings and activities. | Mind and Body
adler | Behind every one who behaves as if he were superior to others, we can suspect a feeling of inferiority which calls for very special efforts of concealment. | Mind and Body
adler | Inferiority feelings are in some degree common to all of us, since we all find ourselves in positions which we wish to improve. | Mind and Body
adler | If we have kept our courage, we shall set about ridding ourselves of these feelings by the only direct, realistic and satisfactory means — by improving the situation. | Mind and Body
adler | But suppose an individual is discouraged; suppose he cannot conceive that if he makes realistic efforts he will improve the situation. He will still be unable to bear his feelings of inferiority; he will still struggle to get rid of them; but he will try methods which bring him no farther ahead. | Mind and Body
adler | As inferiority feelings always produce tension, there will always be a compensatory movement towards a feeling of superiority; but it will no longer be directed towards solving the problem. | Mind and Body
adler | The movement towards superiority will thus be towards the useless side of life. The real problem will be shelved or excluded. | Mind and Body
adler | To some degree or other, every neurotic restricts his field of action, his contacts with the whole situation. He tries to keep at a distance the three real confronting problems of life and confines himself to circumstances in which he feels able to dominate. | Mind and Body
adler | It is not properly to be called psychology if we stick pins into a child and see how far it jumps, or tickle it and see how loud it laughs. | Mind and Body
adler | Every neurotic has an inferiority complex. | Mind and Body
adler | We do not need to ask: we need only watch the individual's behavior. It is there that we shall notice what tricks he uses to reassure himself of his importance. | Mind and Body
adler | Inferiority feelings can express themselves in a thousand ways. | Mind and Body
adler | All three children really felt inferior, but each expressed his feelings in his own way, consonant with his style of life. | Mind and Body
adler | No human being can bear a feeling of inferiority for long; he will be thrown into a tension which necessitates some kind of action. | Mind and Body
adler | His goal is still 'to be superior to difficulties,' but instead of overcoming obstacles he will try to hypnotize himself, or auto-intoxicate himself, into feeling superior. | Mind and Body
adler | Meanwhile his feelings of inferiority will accumulate, because the situation which produces them remains unaltered. | Mind and Body
adler | As soon as we see, however, that he is occupied, like everyone else, in struggling for a feeling of adequacy but has given up hope of altering the objective situation, all his movements begin to fall into coherence. | Mind and Body
adler | If he feels weak, he moves into circumstances where he can feel strong. He does not train to be stronger, to be more adequate; he trains to appear stronger in his own eyes. | Mind and Body
adler | In this way he may drug himself; but the real feelings of inferiority will remain. They will be the same old feelings of inferiority provoked by the same old situation. | Mind and Body
adler | The individual will try to restrict his field of action and will be more occupied in avoiding defeat than in pressing forward to success. | Mind and Body
adler | The most thoroughgoing expression of a retreat before difficulties is suicide. Here the individual gives up before all the problems of life, expresses his conviction that he can do nothing to better his situation. | Mind and Body
adler | The striving for superiority in suicide can be understood when we realize that suicide is always a reproach or a revenge. | Mind and Body
adler | What they would hide from view would be their heightened goal of supremacy, their desire to be the first at all costs. | Mind and Body
adler | A child given to boasting, on the other hand, displays its superiority complex at first view; if we examined its behavior rather than its words, we should soon discover the unadmitted feelings of inferiority. | Mind and Body
adler | The so-called Oedipus Complex is in reality nothing more than a special instance of the 'narrow stable' of the neurotic. | Mind and Body
adler | If an individual is afraid to meet the problem of love in the world at large, he will not succeed in ridding himself of this problem. If he confines his field of action to the family circle, it will not surprise us to find that his sexual strivings also are elaborated within these limits. | Mind and Body
adler | The victims of the Oedipus Complex are children who were pampered by their mothers, who were trained to believe that their wishes carried with them a right to fulfillment, and who never saw that they could win affection and love by their independent efforts outside the bounds of the home. | Mind and Body
adler | These enterprises, so common among modern psychologists, may in fact tell us something of an individual's psychology; but only in so far as they give evidence of a fixed and particular style of life. | Mind and Body
adler | This holds true of those who investigate stimuli and reactions; those who attempt to trace the effect of a trauma or shocking experience; and those who examine inherited abilities and look to see how they unfold themselves. | Mind and Body
adler | Psychologists of many schools have adopted the term and use it in their own practice. I am not at all sure, however, that they understand it or use it with the right meaning. | Mind and Body
adler | Many neurotics, if they were asked whether they felt inferior, would answer, 'No.' Some would even answer, 'Just the opposite. I know quite well that I am superior to the people around me.' | Mind and Body
adler | If we see someone who is arrogant, for example, we can guess that he feels, 'Other people are apt to overlook me. I must show that I am somebody.' | Mind and Body
adler | It does not follow, therefore, that an individual with strong feelings of inferiority will appear to be a submissive, quiet, restrained, inoffensive sort of person. | Mind and Body
adler | If we looked at his movements without understanding we should think them aimless. They would not impress us as designed to improve the situation. | Mind and Body
adler | His efforts to fool himself will meet with only a partial success. | Mind and Body
adler | If he feels unequal to the problems of occupation, he may attempt to reassure himself of his importance by being a domestic tyrant. | Mind and Body
adler | From this definition we can see that anger can be as much an expression of an inferiority complex as tears or apologies. | Mind and Body
adler | He will give the picture of hesitating, of being at a standstill, or even of retreating, before his difficulties. | Mind and Body
adler | Such an attitude can be seen very simply in cases of agoraphobia. This symptom is the expression of conviction, 'I must not go too far. I must keep myself to familiar circumstances. Life is full of dangers and I must avoid encountering them.' | Mind and Body
adler | With every suicide, we can always find someone at whose door he is laying the responsibility for his death. | Mind and Body
adler | Whether he dominates by bullying or by whining will depend on his training: he will choose the device which he has tested best and found most effective for his purposes. | Mind and Body
adler | The discouraged child which finds that it can tyrannize best by tears will be a cry-baby; and a direct line of development leads from the cry-baby to the adult melancholiac. | Mind and Body
adler | Tears and complaints — the means which I have called 'water power' — can be an extremely capable weapon for disturbing cooperation and reducing others to a condition of slavery. | Mind and Body
adler | With such people, as with those who suffer from shyness, embarrassment and feelings of guilt, we should find the inferiority complex on the surface; they would readily admit their weakness and their inability to look after themselves. | Mind and Body
adler | In adult life they remain tied to their mothers' apron strings. In love they look, not for an equal partner, but for a servant; and the servant of whose support they are surest is their mother. | Mind and Body
adler | We could probably induce an Oedipus Complex in any child. All we should need is for its mother to spoil it, and refuse to spread its interest to other people, and for its father to be comparatively indifferent or cold. | Mind and Body
adler | If we see someone who gesticulates strongly when he speaks, we can guess that he feels, 'My words would not carry any weight if I did not emphasize them.' | Mind and Body
adler | It is as if a man feared that he was too small and walked on tiptoe to make himself seem larger. | Mind and Body
adler | In this way he builds for himself a narrow stable, closes the door and spends his life away from the wind, the sunlight and the fresh air. | Mind and Body
adler | What is missing from psychoanalysis is the very first requisite for a science of psychology — a recognition of the coherence of the personality and of the unity of the individual in all his expressions. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | The dream must be a product of the style of life, and it must help to build up and enforce the style of life. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | The purpose of dreams must be in the feelings they arouse. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | The goal of the dream is the feelings it leaves behind. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | The purpose of the dream will be to support and back the style of life, to arouse the feelings suited to it. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | The purpose of dreams, therefore, is to support the style of life against the demands of common sense. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | His main interest is to annoy and hurt his father. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Heredity plays no part in his trouble. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | He has created it himself out of his own experiences. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | We may conclude that the individual's purpose in dreaming is to seek guidance for the future, to seek a solution for his problems. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | From a scientific point of view, the dreamer and the waking man are the same individual, and the purpose of dreams must be applicable to this one coherent personality. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | And, indeed, if we look closely we shall find that the Freudian theory is the consistent psychology of the pampered child, who feels that his instincts must never be denied, who looks on it as unfair that other people should exist, who asks always, 'Why should I love my neighbor? Does my neighbor love me?' | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | But the striving for gratification is only one of the million varieties of the striving for superiority; and we cannot take it as the central motive of all expressions of personality. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | I could see that the dream is not a contradiction to waking life; it must always be in the same line as other movements and expressions of life. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | If, during the day, we are occupied with striving towards the goal of superiority, we must be occupied with the same problem at night. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Everyone must dream as if he had a task to fulfill in dreaming, as if he had to strive towards superiority also in his dreams. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | The dream is only the means, the instrument, to stir up feelings. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | The feelings an individual creates must always be in conformity with his style of life. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | We can conclude that we dream only if we are not sure of the solution of our problems, only if reality is pressing in on us even in our sleep and offering us difficulties. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | This is the task of the dream: to meet the difficulties with which we are confronted and to provide a solution. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | If an individual is confronted by a problem which he does not wish to solve along the lines of common sense, he can confirm his attitude by the feelings which are aroused in his dreams. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Dreaming is the adversary of common sense. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | In dreams we are fooling ourselves. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Every dream is an auto-intoxication, a self-hypnosis. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Its whole purpose is to excite the mood in which we are prepared to meet the situation. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | We should be able to see in it exactly the same personality that we find in everyday life; but we should see him, as it were, in the workshop of the mind, preparing the feelings which he will utilize during the day. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | In the same way in the construction of a dream we pick out only such incidents as agree with our style of life and express what the style of life demands when confronted by our present problems. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | The meaning of the selection can be nothing but the meaning of the style of life in relation to the difficulties in which we find ourselves. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | As long as we fail to stop this fight, treatment will be useless. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | The situation closely resembles the so-called Oedipus Complex. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | This youth is occupied in damaging his father; and he is very much attached to his mother. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | He has suffered from a mistaken training and a mistaken interpretation of his position. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | If the child revolts against its father, and fails to proceed independently in solving the problems before it, we can understand how easy it was to adopt such a style of life. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Of these two, perhaps only the Individual Psychologists would claim that their explanation was wholly in agreement with common sense. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | It seemed clear to me that a man who is dreaming is in a worse position to foretell the future than a man who is awake and in more complete possession of his faculties. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | It seemed clear that dreams would be found, not more intelligent and prophetic than everyday thinking, but more confused and confusing. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | It still seems evident that any solution offered by a dream would be worse than a solution arrived at by common-sense thinking, with the whole situation before us. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Indeed, it is not too much to say that in dreaming an individual is hoping to solve his problems in his sleep. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | In several points, however, the Freudian interpretation has taken the dream out of the region of science. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Wherever we see such contradictions, we must conclude an unscientific attitude of mind. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | If it were true, dreams would have a meaning as an expression not of the whole personality, but only of a part of the personality. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | The difference between dream thought and day thought is not absolute; there is no rigid division between the two. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | We shall probably find that people who do not like to be deluded by their feelings, who prefer to proceed in a scientific way, do not dream often or do not dream at all. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Others, who are further away from common sense, do not want to solve their problems by normal and useful means. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Common sense is an aspect of cooperation; and people who are badly trained for cooperation dislike common sense. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | If we are right, we shall be able to see self-deception even in the construction of a dream, in the means which it employs. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | But your victories damage yourself more than any one. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | He is a pampered child. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | It is not a sexual affair, however. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | His mother has pampered him and his father has been unsympathetic. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Attitudes like this could be provoked anew with every child. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | We need only give the child a mother to pamper it, as this mother did; and a father who is harsh, as this father was. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | As far as I know, there are only two theories of dream-interpretation which attempt to be comprehensive and scientific. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | The two schools which claim to understand and interpret dreams are the Freudian school of psychoanalysis and the school of Individual Psychology. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | From a scientific standpoint, such views seem ridiculous to us. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | This is very far from committing us to a prophetic view of dreams. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | It supposes, for example, a gap between the work of the mind during the day and its work during the night. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Another point of difficulty in the original Freudian view is that dreams were referred to a sexual background. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | The psychoanalyst answers, 'To satisfy the individual's unfulfilled desires.' | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | But this view would by no means explain everything. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Almost every human being dreams, but those who understand their dreams are very few. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Yet, on the whole, men have still no conception of what they are doing when they dream, or why they dream at all. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | It seems always to have been taken granted that dreams had some bearing on the future. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Many people feel that their dreams have a deep significance: they feel them as queer and momentous. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | An incalculable amount of tension and useless effort would be spared in this world if we realized that cooperation and love can never be won by force. | Early Memories
adler | The meaning of marriage is that it should be a partnership of two people for their mutual welfare, for the welfare of their children, and for the welfare of society; and if it fails in any of these respects it is not in coherence with the demands of life. | Early Memories
adler | A fight with a child is always a losing fight: he can never be beaten or won to cooperation by fighting. | Early Memories
adler | The first cooperation among other people which he experiences is the cooperation of his parents; and if their cooperation is poor, they cannot hope to teach him to be cooperative himself. | Early Memories
adler | A child is thus very gravely handicapped if the marriage of his parents is not a cooperative part of social life, a product of social life, and a preparation for social life. | Early Memories
adler | In the whole conduct of the family life there is no call for the use of authority; and it is unfortunate if one member is especially prominent or considered more than the others. | Early Memories
adler | No comradeship is possible to those who look at relations with others as opportunities of defeat or victory. | Early Memories
adler | There should be no ruler in the family and every occasion for feelings of inequality should be avoided. | Early Memories
adler | Punishment, especially corporal punishment, is always harmful to children. | Early Memories
adler | Any teaching which cannot be given in friendship is wrong teaching. | Early Memories
adler | It is only when both partners place their common welfare higher than their individual welfare that a true cooperation can occur. | Early Memories
adler | We can see here another example of the fact that whatever we do for our own descendants we are doing for the whole community. We cannot escape this tie to our fellow men. | Early Memories
adler | It is of the utmost importance that neither the father nor the mother should show any favoritism among their children. | Early Memories
adler | Unless the children feel equal, mankind will never be well prepared in social interest. | Early Memories
adler | We must insist again that the situation is never the same for two children in a family; and each child will show in his style of life the results of his attempts to adapt himself to his own peculiar circumstances. | Early Memories
adler | The importance of a mother's affection and interest can be seen also from the fact that so many failures come from among orphans, illegitimate or unwanted children and the children of broken marriages. | Early Memories
adler | Where the marriage is unhappy, the situation is full of danger for the child. | Early Memories
adler | It is impossible to train a child in cooperation with such an atmosphere around him. | Early Memories
adler | The children of unhappy marriages, unless their first impression is corrected, will grow up with a pessimistic view of marriage. | Early Memories
adler | Nobody likes to be criticized; but if an individual makes it the main interest of his life to escape criticism, all his relations with society are interfered with. | Early Memories
adler | He must meet in a good way the three problems of life — occupation, friendship and love — and he must cooperate on an equal footing with his wife in the care and protection of the family. | Early Memories
adler | Every father should be aware of the fact that our culture has overemphasized the privileged position of the man, and that in consequence his wife, when he married her, was probably in some degree afraid of being dominated and put in an inferior position. | Early Memories
adler | The father's influence on his children is so important that many of them look on him, throughout their lives, either as their ideal or as their greatest enemy. | Early Memories
adler | It is very valuable in the development of children that they should learn that the family is a unit of a larger society and that outside the family there exist also trustworthy human beings and fellow men. | Early Memories
adler | Almost every discouragement in childhood springs from the feeling that someone else is preferred. | Early Memories
adler | Unless girls and boys feel equal, the relations of the two sexes will continue to offer the greatest difficulties. | Early Memories
adler | Individual Psychology has opened up a very wide field for research work by inquiring into the advantages and disadvantages for children according to the order of their birth. | Early Memories
adler | The change always makes a great impression and we can often find in problem children, neurotics, criminals, drunkards and perverts that their difficulties began in such circumstances. | Early Memories
adler | In my own experience in Europe and America I have found that the greatest proportion of problem children are oldest children; and close behind them come the youngest children. | Early Memories
adler | Throughout his childhood he has a pacemaker. There is always a child ahead of him in age and development and he is stimulated to exert himself and catch up. | Early Memories
adler | The best means of bringing up such children is to find a substitute for a mother and father and for a family life; and all we should be doing if we took children from their parents would be hunting around for other people who could fulfill the tasks of parents. | Early Memories
adler | The part of the father in family life is equally important with the mother's part. | Early Memories
adler | The child suffers a serious block in the development of his social feeling. | Early Memories
adler | If the father is high-tempered and tries to dominate the rest of the family, the boys will get a false view of what is expected from a man. | Early Memories
adler | He must prove himself a good fellow man to his wife, to his children and to society. | Early Memories
adler | He should not forget that the woman's part in the creation of family life can never be surpassed. | Early Memories
adler | If a mother tells her children, 'You wait till father comes home', she is preparing them to regard men as the final authorities and the real powers in life. | Early Memories
adler | Secondly, it disturbs the relation of the children with their father and makes them fear him, instead of feeling him a good friend. | Early Memories
adler | By his own attitude he is helping to prepare the way in which his children will face the problem of occupation. | Early Memories
adler | The chief demand upon the husband is that he should be interested in his partner; and it is very easy to see whether one person is interested in another or not. | Early Memories
adler | A father should not think that he can assure the future of his children by money alone. | Early Memories
adler | Where boys are preferred to girls, inferiority complexes amongst the girls are almost inevitable. | Early Memories
adler | Every oldest child has experienced for some time the situation of an only child and has been compelled suddenly to adapt himself to a new situation at the birth of the next oldest. | Early Memories
adler | The second child is in a quite different position, a situation that cannot be compared with that of the other children. | Early Memories
adler | A typical second child is very easy to recognize. He behaves as if he were in a race, as if someone were a step or two in front and he had to hurry to get ahead of him. | Early Memories
adler | If children find dissension between their parents, they are very skillful in playing them off against each other. | Early Memories
adler | Even when they are adults they will feel that marriage is bound to turn out badly. | Early Memories
adler | The girls will suffer still more. In later life they will picture men as tyrants. | Early Memories
adler | Marriage will seem to them a kind of subjugation and slavery. | Early Memories
adler | If the mother is dominating and nags the other members, the position is reversed. | Early Memories
adler | It is unfortunately frequent that the father of the family is given the task of punishing the children. | Early Memories
adler | There is a real danger, however, if the husband and wife have different friends. | Early Memories
adler | The function that everyone expects most definitely of a father is a solution of the problem of occupation. | Early Memories
adler | The sexual partnership should not be taken with so little seriousness. | Early Memories
adler | I believe that in our own time there is a tendency to explain to children far more than they can grasp properly and to rouse interests and feelings for which they are not prepared. | Early Memories
adler | A child whose training in cooperation and independence has been good will never suffer from the talk of his friends; and very often children are more delicate in these matters than their elders. | Early Memories
adler | He should never boast of his greater experience and make capital out of it. He is not the family tutor. | Early Memories
adler | Money should not be overemphasized or made the subject of quarreling. | Early Memories
adler | It is notorious that the part of a stepmother is very difficult, and the children often fight against her. | Early Memories
adler | The girls will probably imitate her and become sharp and critical themselves. | Early Memories
adler | The boys will always be on the defensive, afraid of criticism and keeping watch for attempts to subjugate them. | Early Memories
adler | A husband should not show his affection for his wife too strikingly before the children. | Early Memories
adler | A 'street explanation' never harmed a child who was not already prepared to take a mistaken view. | Early Memories
adler | It thus falls to the father's part to be the adviser of his wife and children in these problems. | Early Memories
adler | Of all mistakes made in education, the belief in hereditary limits to development is the worst. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | Good and bad, like other expressions of character, have meaning only in a social context; they are the result of training in a social environment, among our fellow men, and they imply a judgment, conducive to the welfare of others, or opposed to the welfare of others. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | The child who has not learned to cooperate is the neurotic, the drunkard, the criminal or the suicide of later years. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | We can hope, however, to reach all the teachers and through them to reach all the children; to correct the mistakes which have already been made and to train the children for an independent, courageous and cooperative life. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | In this work, it seems to me, lies the greatest promise for the future welfare of mankind. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | After the experiences of these fifteen years, I think I may say that these Advisory Councils have proved a complete success and offer us the best instrument we possess for dealing with the problems of childhood and educating children to be responsible fellow men. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | We need the most intimate cooperation between the psychiatrist and the teacher. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | The teacher must know everything the psychiatrist knows, so that after discussing the child's problem he can proceed on his own, without further help. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | It is the task of schoolteachers to notice the difficulties of the children and to correct the mistakes of the parents. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | We can see, in this situation, how children who are not taken into the class as part of the whole are provoked to train themselves towards a criminal career. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | The best way to teach subjects is in coherence with the rest of life, so that the children can see the purpose of the instruction and the practical value of what they are learning. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | As the family should be a unit, with each member an equal part of the whole, so, too, should the class. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | The greatest difficulty in education is provided, not by the limitations of the child, but by what he thinks are his limitations. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | In education we should be occupied in increasing the courage and interest of a child and in removing the limits which, through his interpretation of life, he has set to his own powers. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | If an educator really attributed the whole development of character and intelligence to heredity, I do not see how he could possibly hope to accomplish anything in his profession. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | It is not the deficiency itself which affects the mind, but the child's attitude to his deficiency, and his consequent training. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | Now many other psychiatrists and psychologists have come round to the same point of view, and the belief in inherited components of character may be called a superstition. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | The greatest factor in the development of mental faculties is interest; and we have seen how interest is blocked, not through heredity, but through discouragement and the fear of defeat. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | Behind every exceptional degree of ability we shall find, not an exceptional heredity, but a long interest and training. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | No teacher can succeed in removing the limits a child has set to his own development if he himself believes that there are fixed limits to development. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | Indeed, this is the only way in which we can really help the backward child; by letting him see the mistakes he has made in his estimate of his own capacities, we can set him free to progress by his own efforts. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | When the child first goes to school, he is facing a new test in social life; and this test will reveal any mistakes in his development. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | Every child who is backward but not definitely feeble-minded is hesitating before the problem of adjustment to social life; and the teacher is in the best position to help him to meet what is a new situation for him. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | He can never be interested by severity or punishment. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | If a child comes to school and finds it difficult to make a bridge with his teachers and fellow children, the worst thing to do is to criticize him and scold him. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | If a teacher is to attract the interest of a child, he will understand what the child's interests have been previously and convince him that he can make a success in this interest and in others. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | If anyone is to blame, it is rather the teachers and parents who have not found the right method of interesting the children. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | Under our present system we generally find that when children first come to school they are more prepared for competition than for cooperation; and the training in competition continues throughout their schooldays. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | This is a disaster for the child; and it is hardly less of a disaster if he goes ahead and strains to beat the other children than if he falls behind and gives up the struggle. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | It ought to be realized, however, that we can never predict the limits of a child's future growth. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | The Intelligence Quotient should be used only to acquaint us with a child's difficulties, so that we may find a method to overcome them. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | Even the worst pupil can improve, however; and there are sufficient examples, among the most famous men, to show that a child who is backward at school may recover his courage and interest and go forward to great achievements. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | It gives teachers and parents an opportunity to explain away their errors and diminish their efforts. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | Every attempt to avoid responsibility should be opposed. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | If a child suffers, therefore, from any organic disability, it is especially necessary that he should be given no reason to conclude that he is limited in intelligence or character. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | Before a child is born, he has no social environment in this sense. At birth he has potentialities to develop in either direction. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | In principle, coeducation deserves every support. It is an excellent means for boys and girls to know each other better and to learn to cooperate with the other sex. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | Those who believe that coeducation meets all problems, however, are making a great error. Coeducation provides a special problem of its own; and unless the special problem is recognized and dealt with as a problem, the distance between the sexes is greater with coeducation than without it. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | If he has been pampered at home, he will perhaps be unwilling to leave his sheltered life and join in with the other children. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | In this way we can see in his very first day at school the limits of social feeling in a pampered child. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | At school, however, he is no longer pampered and he feels the situation as a defeat. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | It is mainly the children to whom school is thus made an artificially unpleasant environment who play truant, are bad pupils and give the appearance of being stupid and difficult to handle. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | From the first, therefore, we should find out how the child looks at the world and which sense organ has occupied most of his attention and been trained to the highest degree. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | A question is often raised whether it is better to teach children subjects or teach them to think for themselves. It seems to me that too severe an antithesis is made in this question. Both methods can be combined. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | Sometimes people doubt whether children can really be trained to understand one another and help in this way; but it is my experience that children often understand better than their elders. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | One frequent suggestion for increasing the unity and cooperation of a class is to make the children self-governing; but in such attempts I think that we must go carefully, under the guidance of a teacher, and assuring ourselves that the children are rightly prepared. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | Nor should the child himself or the child's parents be acquainted with his Intelligence Quotient. They do not know the purpose of the tests and they think that they represent a final judgment. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | If a child knows that his Intelligence Quotient is low, he may become hopeless and believe that success is beyond him. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | If a teacher gives a child a bad report, he believes that he is stimulating him to struggle harder. If the child has had a severe upbringing at home, however, he will be afraid to take his report back with him. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | I think that it is a great help if the children have the same teacher for several years. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | It is still more unfortunate if children repeat their classes. Every schoolteacher will agree that children who repeat classes are generally a problem in school and at home. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | One of the difficulties, for example, is that girls develop quicker than boys until their sixteenth year. If the boys do not understand this, it is difficult for them to preserve their self-esteem. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | The classroom is not the right place for sexual education; if a teacher speaks to the whole class he has no means of knowing that each child understands him in the right way. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | We cannot, in our present society, hope to reach all the parents and help them to avoid mistakes. The parents who most need advice are the parents who never come for it. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | Often parents tell us of a problem child that he gives no trouble at home; that problems only arise when he is at school. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | If such children have no opportunity to learn through the eyes, they will be backward. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | Crowded classes, however, are certainly a disadvantage. The problems of some of the children are concealed and it is difficult to treat them rightly. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | It is not often an advantage for a child to skip a class; he is generally burdened with expectations which he does not fulfill. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | Of course, if a child wishes to know more and asks him questions in private, the teacher should give him true and straightforward answers. | Case Studies and Practical Applications
adler | With the criminal, as with the neurotic, we can do absolutely nothing, unless we can succeed in winning him for cooperation. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | I cannot stress this point too strongly: everything is secured if we can win the interest of the criminal for human welfare, if we can win his interest for other human beings, if we can train him for cooperation, if we can set him on the way towards solving the problems of life by cooperative means. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | What shall we do if I am right, and we can always find in the criminal career the striving for a fictitious personal superiority in an individual who is lacking in social interest and has not been trained in cooperation? | The Role of Social Interest
adler | If we fail to do this, we can do nothing. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | The main features of his personality had already been decided by the time he was four or five years old: by that time he had already made those mistakes in his estimate of himself and of the world which we see displayed in his criminal career. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | Our only remedy is to find out the block to cooperation which the criminal suffered in childhood. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | We are now really faced with the problem, what shall we do? | The Role of Social Interest
adler | If we are to change him we must find the roots of his pattern. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | We must discover where his failures first began and the circumstances which provoked them. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | It is these primitive mistakes which we must understand and correct. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | The criminal is interested only in himself and his own point of view. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | We cannot convince him, therefore, unless we can get behind all his interpretations, all his training in his own point of view; and discover the way in which his attitude first began. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | Since he is not interested in the social demands of life, he takes them for his friends and society in general for his enemies. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | We should never allow him to lose hope and we could stop it very easily if we organized our schools so that such children were given confidence and courage. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | Here Individual Psychology has opened up for us the whole dark territory. We can see much clearer. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | Heredity and environment contribute something to his development; but we are not so much concerned with what a child brings into the world, or with the experiences he encounters, as with the way he utilizes them, how he turns them to account and what he effects with them. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | On this point the first responsibility rests with the mother. She must understand how to enlarge the bonds of this interest; how to spread the interest in herself until it becomes an interest in other people. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | She must behave in such a way that the child can be interested in the whole of mankind and his own whole future life. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | Wherever the social interest is blocked, only an egoistic attitude is left. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | All this proves how hard they must struggle to break through the wall of social interest. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | His mind is made up. He has been seeing the world in this way for years. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | We must look for the first development of his attitude. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | Later on, he turns everything which he experiences into a justification for his attitude; and if his experiences do not quite fit into his scheme he broods on them and licks them into shape until they are more amenable. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | He has his own way of looking and listening and we can often see that he pays no attention to things which do not agree with his own interpretation of life. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | This is one reason why corporal punishment is ineffective. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | The criminal sees it as a confirmation that society is hostile and impossible to cooperate with. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | They understand him; they do not reproach him; on the contrary they flatter him, play on his ambitions, and give him the hope of making his mark on the useless side of life. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | It is in this way that thousands of children join criminal gangs. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | If in later life we treat them in the same fashion, they will find only new testimony that we are their enemies and only criminals are their friends. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | A criminal will interpret punishment only as a sign that society is against him, as he always thought. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | They see their contact with society as a sort of continuous warfare, in which they are trying to gain the victory. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | If we take it in the same way ourselves we are only playing into their hands. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | The criminal conceives himself as playing against odds; and the higher the penalty, the greater is his desire to show his superior cunning. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | By the age of five years a child's psyche is a unit: the threads of his personality have been drawn together. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | The extenuating circumstance for all criminals is that they have a certain degree of cooperation, but not sufficient for the demands of our social life. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | Interest in other children is also very important for the development of social interest. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | The child feels: 'Why should I do anything for other people?'; and, as he cannot solve the problems of life in this frame of mind, he is bound to hesitate and look for an evasion and an easy way out. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | In every description of a criminal career I believe I could show all the points I have brought out. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | We cannot win him by making things easy for him, any more than by making them hard for him. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | We cannot win him by pointing out that he is wrong and arguing with him. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | If a man has the attitude, 'Other people misuse me and humiliate me,' he will find plenty of evidence to confirm him. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | He will be looking for such evidence and evidence on the other side will not be noticed. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | He feels only that the situation is still more hopeless. He feels that people are against him. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | The child loses his remainder of confidence. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | He is not interested in school tasks, or in his teachers, or in his schoolmates. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | In these places he finds other boys who have had the same experience and have taken the same road. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | There is no cause at all why such a child should be defeated by the tasks of life. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | Corporal punishment is ineffective for other reasons, also. Many criminals are not very fond of their lives. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | Some of them at certain moments of their lives are very near suicide. Corporal punishment does not terrify them. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | They can be so intoxicated by their desire to outdo the police that it does not even hurt them. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | If attendants are harsh, or if they are severely treated, they are put on their mettle to resist. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | This increases again their feeling of being cleverer than the police. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | Even the electric chair can act as a challenge in this sense. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | It is all the more necessary that we should understand this point, since we really do not know anything of inherited abilities or disabilities. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | The task is not quite as simple as it looks. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | Which of us would cultivate a liking for a place where we expected to be reproached and punished? | The Role of Social Interest
adler | He begins to play truant and to hide himself away where he cannot be discovered. | The Role of Social Interest
adler | We can say that they are all aspects of the same situation and the same problem — the necessity for a human being to preserve life, and to further life, in the environment in which he finds himself. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | As far as we can understand from our relation to our own planet, earth, the logical answer to the problem of occupation, the only answer in accordance with common sense, is that we should work, cooperate and contribute. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | This is the style of life of the pampered child: to demand whenever a problem faces him that it should be solved for him by the efforts of his fellows. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | It is chiefly the pampered child who holds back the cooperation of mankind and throws unfair burdens on those who are actively engaged in solving the problems of life. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | These three problems are never found apart; they all throw cross-lights on one another; a solution of one helps towards the solution of the others. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | A woman who contributes to the life of mankind by the occupation of motherhood is taking as high a place in the division of human labor as anyone else could take. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | The efforts and training of the first four or five years of life are decisive for the child's main sphere of action in adult life. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | It is true that we cannot boast of having achieved everything that could be done; and we cannot pretend that the division of labor has reached its most fruitful development. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | For a successful solution of the problem of love and marriage, an occupation contributing to the division of labor is necessary, as well as a good and friendly contact with other human beings. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | In our own day, the highest solution for this problem, the solution most coherent with the demands of society and of the division of labor, is monogamy. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | In our own culture the work of a mother is undervalued and often regarded as a not very attractive or estimable occupation. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | The success of the family, however, rests equally upon the work of the mother and the work of the father. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | His memories of this period show conclusively what he has trained himself for most continuously: they reveal his prototype and his underlying scheme of apperception. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | It is our task to recognize the underlying motives, to see the way they are striving, what is pushing them forward, where they are placed, their goal of superiority and how they feel they can make it concrete. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | In a child's choice of an occupation we can observe his whole style of life. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | He is showing us the main direction of his striving and what he values most in life. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | If he really does his work and occupies himself in a contribution to others, he is on the same level of usefulness as anyone else. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | There are some people who could choose any occupation and never be satisfied. What they wish is not an occupation but an easy guarantee of superiority. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | They do not wish to meet the problems of life, since they feel that it is unfair of life to offer them problems at all. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | Some people attempt to evade this problem of occupation; to do no work or to occupy themselves outside of common human interests. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | We shall always find, however, that if they dodge this problem, they will in fact be claiming support from their fellows. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | In one way or another they will be living on the labor of others without making a contribution of their own. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | On his approach to the other sex and the fulfillment of his sexual role depends his part in the continuance of mankind. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | In the way in which an individual answers this problem the degree of his cooperation can always be seen. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | It is paid only indirectly and a woman who makes it her main occupation is generally placed in a position of economic dependence. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | A mother is the first influence in the development of her children's occupational interests. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | A child's development is much simpler if he knows from his childhood onwards the occupation which he would like to take up in later life. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | A child of twelve or fourteen should already know much more of the occupation which he will follow; and I am always sorry to hear at this age that a child does not know what he wishes to be in later life. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | His apparent lack of ambition does not mean that he has no interest at all. He is probably extremely ambitious and not courageous enough to mention what his ambitions are. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | These children we can recognize to be very ambitious but not really cooperative. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | They have not felt their way in the division of labor and they cannot find in time a concrete method of fulfilling their ambitions. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | It is thus an advantage to ask children early what their occupation is going to be; and I often put this question in schools so that the children are led to consider the point and cannot forget the problem or wish to hide their answer. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | We must let him value as he chooses; since we ourselves have no means of saying which occupation is higher and which is lower. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | Perhaps a great majority of men and women are really interested in the direction in which they have trained themselves in the first four or five years and cannot forget these interests. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | But they have felt compelled by economic considerations or by the pressure of their parents to take a different direction and engage in an occupation which does not interest them. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | This is another sign of the importance of childhood training. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | In vocational guidance, first memories should be considered very important. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | One of the most frequent strivings is the attempt to excel other members of the family; and especially to go farther than the father or mother. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | This can be a very valuable striving; we are glad to see an advancement on the position of older generations. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | There are still other children who never wish to be placed in a leading position. Their chief interest is to find a leader to look up to, another child or adult to whom they can subordinate themselves. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | This is not a very favorable development and I should be pleased if we could decrease such submissive tendencies. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | The mistaken training of avoiding an occupation, being distracted or lazy, also begins early in life. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | The third tie of a human being is that he is a member of one of the two sexes and not of the other. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | I believe that our schools now are giving more attention to the future occupation of the child, to training his hands, ears and eyes, his faculties and functions. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | Such training is as important as the teaching of special subjects. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | We should not forget, however, that the teaching of subjects is also important for the child's occupational development. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | In the study of all these subjects, we have found, through the combined experience of the past, an excellent occasion to train all the functions of the mind. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | Their answers are not clearly considered; and when they say that they want to be aeroplane pilots or engine drivers they do not know why they are choosing this occupation. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | In such a case we must take pains to find out his chief interest and training. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | Some children, when they finish high school at the age of sixteen, are still unsettled over their future occupation. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | Often they are brilliant pupils but have no idea of how their life will continue. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | If in a child's first memories we see an interest in visual things, we can conclude that he will be more apt for an occupation in which he can use his eyes. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | We know that he is an acoustic type and we can guess that he might be suited for some profession connected with music. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | These are individuals who demand more activity; perhaps they would be interested in occupation which demanded outside labor or travel. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | By watching children we can often see them training for an occupation in adult life. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | The games of children can give us a hint of their interests. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | This interest in training to take the role of a mother should be encouraged and we need not be afraid of giving little girls dolls to play with. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | Many children show great mechanical and technical interest; and this, too, is a promise of a fruitful occupation in later life if they can accomplish what they wish. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | Children who meet the problem of sickness or death without preparation always remain with a great interest in these facts. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | They wish to be doctors, nurses or chemists. Their strivings, I believe, should be encouraged. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | Sometimes an experience of death can be compensated in another way. The child will have the ambition to survive death through artistic or literary creation; or he may become devoutly religious. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | In later life we often hear people say that they have forgotten the Latin or French which they learned at school; but, perhaps, all the same, it was not a mistake to teach these subjects. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | If we ask children what they would like to be, most of them will give an answer. | Challenges in Modern Society
adler | All my efforts are devoted towards increasing the social interest of the patient. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | As soon as he can connect himself with his fellow men on an equal and cooperative footing, he is cured. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Their aim is to educate the child to be a fellow man, an equal part of the whole of mankind. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | It can easily be shown that love and marriage are one side of cooperation – not a cooperation for the welfare of two persons only, but a cooperation also for the welfare of mankind. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | I myself try to relieve the whole tension by proposing to them, as the first rule in treatment, 'Never do anything you don't like.' | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Another attacks their style of life still more directly. I tell them, 'You can be cured in fourteen days if you follow this prescription. Try to think every day how you can please someone.' | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | I know that the real reason for his malady is his lack of cooperation and I want him to see it too. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Life in the family and life at school are preparations for a larger whole. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | All that we demand of a human being, and the highest praise that we can give him, is that he should be a good fellow worker, a friend to all other men, and a true Partner in love and marriage. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | If we are to put it in a word, we may say that he should prove himself a fellow man. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Love, with its fulfillment, marriage, is the most intimate devotion towards a partner of the other sex, expressed in physical attraction, in comradeship, and in the decision to have children. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | We could even say that for a full solution of this cooperation of two, each partner must be more interested in the other than in himself. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | This is the only basis on which love and marriage can be successful. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | If each partner is to be more interested in the other partner than in himself, there must be equality. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Here we find the fundamental guarantee of marriage, the fundamental meaning of happiness in this relation. It is the feeling that you are worthwhile, that you cannot be replaced, that your partner needs you, that you are acting well, that you are a fellow man and a true friend. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Melancholiacs are often inclined to revenge themselves by committing suicide, and the doctor's first care is to avoid giving them an excuse for suicide. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | This rule is a great relief and I have never had a suicide among my patients. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | We have seen how it is best for a child to feel himself an equal part of his family and to take an interest in all the other members. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | We have seen how, in the school, the child should feel himself a part of the class, a friend to the other children and able to rely on their friendship. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Only in these conditions will he preserve his courage and meet the problems of life without tension, finding solutions for them which increase the welfare of others. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | If he can be a good friend to all men and contribute to them by useful work and by a happy marriage, he will never feel inferior to others or defeated by them. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | To take up his tasks means to assume responsibility for solving the three problems of life in a cooperative way. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | These German villagers have recognized that cooperation is the chief prerequisite for marriage. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | This standpoint, that love and marriage are a cooperation for the welfare of mankind, throws light on every aspect of the problem. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | It is easy to understand that if an individual is interested in his fellows and in the welfare of mankind, everything he does will be guided by the interests of his fellows. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | If we apply this understanding to the problem of love and marriage we shall see, here again, that the interest of the whole, the interest in mankind, must always be involved. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | If there is to be so intimate a devotion, neither partner can feel subdued nor overshadowed. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | It should be the effort of each to ease and enrich the life of the other. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Two people cannot live together fruitfully if one wishes to rule and force the other to obey. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Comrades must be equal, and when people are equal, they will always find a way to settle their difficulties. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Melancholia is like a long-continued rage and reproach against others, though for the purpose of gaining care, sympathy and support, the patient seems only to be dejected about his own guilt. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | If a melancholiac is able to do anything he wants, whom can he accuse? What has he got to revenge himself for? | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Social feeling is not, perhaps, an inherited instinct; but the potentiality for social feeling is inherited. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | This potentiality is developed in accordance with the mother's skill and her interest in the child, and in accordance with the child's own judgment of his environment. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | We have seen that the parents should themselves be good friends to each other and should have good and intimate friendships in the outer world. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | He will feel that he is at home in the universe, in a friendly place, meeting people he likes and equal to all his difficulties. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | He will feel, 'This world is my world. I must act and organize, not wait and expect.' | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | It is our world to work in and improve and we can hope that if any one takes up his tasks in the right way he can do his part in improving it. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Even physical attraction, the most important of all human strivings, has been a most necessary development for mankind. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Every human being is bound by definite ties; his development takes place within a definite framework and he must conform his decisions to this framework. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Our drives have all been adapted to our common culture; they all reflect the efforts we have learned to make for the welfare of mankind and for our life in association. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | This interest is primary. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Nobody can bear a position of inferiority without anger and disgust. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | In our present-day civilization people are not often well prepared for cooperation. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Our training has been too much towards individual success, towards considering what we can get out of life rather than what we can give to it. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Instead of making a trifle out of it, we should rather agree with the child that love is a marvelous task, a task for which he should be prepared, a task on behalf of the whole of mankind. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | The key to helpfulness is never to lie to a child, never to evade his questions, to understand what is behind his questions, to explain only as much as he wishes to learn and only as much as we are sure he can understand. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | So long as there is an observer, there is no danger. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | If he feels that other people are hostile, if he feels that he is surrounded by enemies and has his back against the wall, we cannot expect him to make friends and to be a good friend himself. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | If he feels that others should be his slaves, he will wish, not to contribute to others, but to rule them. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | If he is interested in his own sensations and in his physical irritations and discomforts, he will shut himself off from society. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | In this way their children come to feel that trustworthy human beings exist outside the family, also. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | He will be wholly sure that the present time is only one time in the history of mankind, and that he belongs to the whole human process, past, present and future. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | It is true that there are evils and difficulties and prejudices and disasters in this world; but it is our own world and its advantages and disadvantages are our own. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | The chief way to preserve human life was to propagate it; hence our fertility and the continual striving of physical attraction. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | If we are trying, therefore, to come to a right conclusion, our approach must be quite without prejudice. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Love is not a purely natural task, as some psychologists believe. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | Sex is a drive or instinct; but the question of love and marriage is not quite simply how we are to satisfy this drive. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | In a child's characteristic behavior, in his attitudes, thoughts and actions, we can see how he is training himself for adult situations. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | In its main features his approach to love is already established by the fifth or sixth year. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | I should never encourage parents to explain the physical relations of sex too early in life or to explain more than their children wish to learn. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | In my own experience children who were introduced to the facts of adult relations in early life, at four, five or six years of age, and children who had precocious experiences, are always more scared of love in later life. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | A melancholiac's first memory is generally something like this: 'I remember I wanted to lie on the couch, but my brother was lying there. I cried so much that he had to leave.' | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | For many people this is bound to be a new task. To some degree we have been educated to work alone; to some degree we have been educated to work in a team or a crowd. | Educational and Therapeutic Implications
adler | The solution of the problem of love and marriage in our practical and social life is monogamy. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | The fact that we live on this planet, in association with human beings equal to ourselves, and divided into two sexes, and the fact that we must solve the three problems of life which our circumstances set us in a sufficient way, will help us to see that the fullest and highest development of the individual in those and marriage can best be secured by monogamy. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | We can say, therefore, that for a full solution of the problem of love and marriage a decision to have children is necessary. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | A good marriage is the best means we know for bringing up the future generation of mankind, and marriage should always have this in view. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | It is when two people are married that the possibilities of their relationship begin; it is during marriage that they are faced with the real tasks of life and the real opportunity to create for the sake of society. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | The attitude of every individual towards marriage is one of the expressions of his style of life: we can understand it if we understand the whole individual, not unless. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | Now if one human being is really interested in another, he must have all the characteristics belonging to that interest; he must be true, a good friend; he must feel responsible, he must make himself faithful and trustworthy. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | The right solution of the problem of love and marriage belongs to the highest fulfillment of the whole personality. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | There is no problem more closely involved with happiness and a true and useful expression in life. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | Marriage is too high an ideal and the solution of the task demands too much of our effort and creative activity for us to load it with such additional burdens. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | Every individual has his characteristic approach, his characteristic gait and temperament in wooing; and this is always congruous with his style of life. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | In this amative temperament we can see whether he says 'Yes' to the future of mankind, is confident and cooperative; or is interested only in his own person, suffers from stage fright, and tortures himself with the question, 'What sort of a show am I making? What do they think of me?' | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | The sexual attraction towards the other partner is necessary but it should always be molded along the line of a desire for human welfare. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | This stop implies always a lack of interest; it tells us that the individual no longer feels equal, friendly and cooperative towards his partner, no longer wishes to enrich the life of his partner. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | Sometimes the mouth lies or the head does not understand; but the functions of the body always speak the truth. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | If the functions are deficient, it follows that there is no true agreement between these two people. They have lost interest in each other. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | We shall find, therefore, that in this problem of love and marriage those people who are most spontaneously interested in the welfare of mankind are the most likely to have children. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | Those who are not interested, consciously or unconsciously, in their fellow beings, refuse the burden of procreation. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | Anyone who starts the relation which demands such an intimate devotion, such an interest in another person, cannot shake the fundamental basis of this relation and search for an escape. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | It is a mistake to regard love and marriage as if they were a paradise; and it is a mistake, too, to regard marriage as if it were the end of a story. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | Another point important to realize is that love by itself does not settle everything. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | There are all kinds of love, and it is better to rely upon work, interest, and cooperation to solve the problems of marriage. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | This is a dangerous type in our social life — these grown-up pampered children whose style of life has been fixed in the first four or five years of life and who always have the scheme of apperception: 'Can I get all I want?' | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | They make themselves sick and neurotic and out of their mistaken style of life they construct a philosophy. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | I believe that at the least a human being who has not succeeded in accomplishing such a love life or such a marriage should understand that on this point his life has been a mistake. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | It is necessary, too, to be interested in the welfare of the children; and if a marriage is based upon different outlooks from the one I have supported, there are great difficulties for the bringing up of children. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | If the parents quarrel and look on their marriage as a trifle, if they do not see it as if its problems could be solved and the relationship could be continued successfully, it is not a very favorable situation for helping the children to be sociable. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | This is really making love and marriage into a mere patent medicine, and these individuals are bound to lose very greatly. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | We cannot treat it as a trifle. We cannot look on love and marriage as a remedy for a criminal career, for drunkenness or neurosis. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | A neurotic needs to have the right treatment before he is fitted for love and marriage; and if he enters them before he is capable of approaching them rightly, he is bound to run into new dangers and misfortunes. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | Can it be easy to solve the problems of love and marriage while half of mankind is disappointed and discouraged, does not agree with its position and objects to the greater freedom of the other half? | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | Human beings are neither polygamous nor monogamous. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | One partner, or both, must be occupied so that they can earn their living and support a family and we can understand that the right preparation for marriage includes also the right preparation for work. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | We can always find the degree of courage and the degree of capacity to cooperate in the approach to the other sex. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | So long as this cultural demand exists, therefore, it is necessary to train boys in the masculine attitude — to take the initiative, not to hesitate or look for an escape. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | They can be trained, however, only if they feel themselves to be a part of the whole social life and accept its advantages and disadvantages as their own. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | If the partners are really interested in each other, there will never be the difficulty of sexual attraction coming to an end. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | People may think, sometimes, that the interest continues but the attraction has ceased. This is never true. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | This is another way in which the welfare and continuance of mankind is guaranteed; it is a way by which mankind can increase, become numerous, and secure its welfare and survival by the greatness of its numbers. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | If they are always demanding and expecting, never giving, they do not like children. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | They are interested in only their own persons and they regard children as a bother, a trouble, a nuisance; something that will prevent them from keeping their interest in themselves. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | The other point of view, the point of view of marriage as an end, as a final goal, is very much too prominent in our culture. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | I can tell exactly how many people have this attitude: all the people who remain pampered children. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | If they can't get everything that they want, they think life is purposeless. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | They become pessimistic: they conceive a 'death wish.' | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | Are we going to put it in the hands of people who themselves are not rightly taught, who themselves do not understand that marriage is a task, who themselves are interested only in their own persons? | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | You will see very often that people divorce and remarry again and again and always make the same mistake. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | A similar mistake is made when people look upon marriage as a solution for a personal problem. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | I am sure we should not try to depreciate or diminish this problem but to set it on a higher level. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | There is no question but that men in our culture already have an easier time. This is a mistake in our common approach. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | Another problem which also helps to show us the preparation for marriage is the problem of occupation. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | To-day the solution of this problem is put before the solution of love and marriage. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | We cannot judge a man's fitness for marriage entirely by his courtship; for there he has a direct goal before him and in other ways he may be indecisive. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | Nevertheless we can gather from it sure indications of his personality. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | In our own cultural conditions (and only in these conditions) it is generally expected that the man should be the first to express attraction, that the man should make the first approach. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | Of course, girls and women are also engaged in wooing, they also take the initiative; but in our prevailing cultural conditions, they feel obliged to be more reserved. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | A man's approach, therefore, may be called simpler and shallower, a woman's deeper and more complicated. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | In one other way the sex drive in human beings is different from the sex drive among other beings. It is continuous. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | Probably there are reasons why people should not live together; probably there are cases where it would be better that they should be apart. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | There is no place for such jokes in marriage. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | Dancing is a type of activity in which two people have to accomplish a common task, and I think it is good for children to be trained in dancing. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | If, however, we had simple and easy dances for children, it would be a great help for their development. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | I am sure that in time they will change their mind and cease to give such advice. | Conclusion and Reflections
adler | I believe that we should not undervalue dancing. | Conclusion and Reflections
