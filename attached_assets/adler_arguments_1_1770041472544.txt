## Introduction to The Neurotic Constitution

### Argument 9 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- This method of approach leads us to view the compulsion of evolution and the pathological elaboration as the result of a conflict which breaks forth in the organic sphere for the purpose of attaining equipoise, functional capability and adaptation.
- The same struggle in the psychic sphere is under the command of a fictitious idea of personality whose influence dominates the development of the neurotic character and symptoms.

**→ Conclusion:** In the psychic sphere, the development of neurotic character and symptoms is dominated by a fictitious idea of personality.

### Argument 10 (analogical)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- After I had made the attempt to investigate in the Studie uber Minderwertigkeit -von Organen the structure and tectonic of organs in association with their genetic basis, their functional capability and destiny, I proceeded, supporting myself upon already available data as well as upon my own experience, to apply the same method in the study of psychopathology.
- In the book before us are embraced the most important results of my comparative, individual-psychologic studies of the neuroses.

**→ Conclusion:** The study of psychopathology can be approached using the same comparative method applied to somatic inferiority, yielding significant results in understanding neuroses.

### Argument 11 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- If in the organic sphere, 'the individual develops into a unit mass in which all of the individual parts co-operate toward a common goal' (Virchow), if the various abilities and tendencies of the individual tend toward a purposefully directed, unit-personality, then we may look upon every single manifestation of life as if in its past, present and future there are contained traces of a dominating, guiding idea.

**→ Conclusion:** Every single manifestation of life contains traces of a dominating, guiding idea that directs the individual’s past, present, and future.

### Argument 12 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The same struggle in the psychic sphere is under the command of a fictitious idea of personality whose influence dominates the development of the neurotic character and symptoms.
- This fictitious idea aligns with the themes of guiding fictions and neurotic behavior explored in later sections of the book.

**→ Conclusion:** The fictitious idea of personality is central to understanding the guiding fictions that influence neurotic behavior.

---

### Argument 13 (definitional)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- As was the case in the theory of somatic inferiority, an empiric basis is made use of in comparative individual psychology for the purpose of establishing a fictive standard of normality in order to enable one to measure and compare with it grades of deviation from it.

**→ Conclusion:** Comparative individual psychology establishes a fictive standard of normality to measure and compare deviations in neurotic behavior.

### Argument 14 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**

---

### Argument 15 (methodological)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- In both of these scientific endeavors, the comparative method of study reckons with the origin of phenomena, dismisses from consideration the present and seeks to outline from them the future.

**→ Conclusion:** The comparative method in psychology focuses on the origin of phenomena and future implications rather than the present state.

## The Origin and Development of the Feeling of Inferiority

### Argument 17 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- No matter where one begins with the analysis of psychogenic disorders, one and the same phenomenon forces itself upon one's attention after the briefest observation.
- The entire picture of the neurosis as well as all its symptoms are influenced by, nay, even wholly provoked by an imaginary fictitious goal.
- This final purpose has a creative, directive and adjustive power.

**→ Conclusion:** The potency of this 'goal idea' is revealed to us by the trend and evaluation of the pathological phenomena.

*Source: The Origin and Development of the Feeling of Inferiority | Importance: 10/10*

---

### Argument 18 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The neurotic goal (Zwecksetzung) has revealed itself to us in the heightened ego-consciousness (Personlichkeitsgefuhl).
- The simplest formula is to be recognized in an exaggerated 'masculine protest' (Mannlicher Protest).
- This formula: 'I wish to be a complete man' is the guiding fiction in every neurosis, claiming higher reality values than even the normal psyche.

**→ Conclusion:** The guiding fiction in every neurosis is the exaggerated 'masculine protest,' expressed as 'I wish to be a complete man.'

*Source: The Origin and Development of the Feeling of Inferiority | Importance: 10/10*

---

### Argument 19 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The first objection is directed against the view that the libido is the motive force behind the phenomena of the neurosis.
- On the contrary it is the neurosis which shows more clearly than does normal psychic conduct how by means of this neurotic positing of a 'final purpose,' the apperception of pleasure, its selection and power are all driven in the direction of this final purpose.
- The neurotic can really only follow the allurement of the acquisition of pleasure with his healthy psychic force, so to speak, while for the neurotic portion only 'higher' goals are of value.

**→ Conclusion:** The libido is not the motive force behind the phenomena of the neurosis; instead, it is directed by the neurotic's final purpose.

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- Freud's view that the libido is the motive force behind the phenomena of the neurosis.

### Argument 20 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- A second objection is directed against Freud's fundamental view of the sexual etiology of the neuroses.
- The applicability of the sexual picture deceives the normal person and especially the neurotic, but it must not deceive the psychologist.
- The sexual content in the neurotic phenomenon originates primarily in the imaginary antithesis: 'Masculine-feminine' and is evolved through a change of form of the 'masculine protest.'
- The sexual trend in the fantasy and life of the neurotic follows the direction of the 'masculine goal,' and is really not a trend, but a compulsion.

**→ Conclusion:** The sexual etiology of the neuroses is not the primary cause; instead, sexual content originates from the 'masculine protest' and is a compulsion directed by the 'masculine goal.'

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- Freud's view of the sexual etiology of the neuroses.

### Argument 21 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The study of the neurotic character is an essential part of neuropsychology.
- Like all other psychic phenomena it can only be understood when taken in connection with the entire psychic life.
- A cursory knowledge of the neuroses suffices to enable one to discover that which is peculiarly characteristic in them and all writers who have studied the problem of nervousness have laid particular stress upon certain peculiar traits of character.

**→ Conclusion:** The neurotic shows a series of sharply emphasized traits of character which exceed the normal standard.

### Argument 22 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- A sickly girl who during her entire childhood in her consciousness of an unusual insecurity leans upon her father and in so doing strives to become superior to her mother, may comprehend this psychic constellation in the form of an incest, as if she wished to be the wife of her father.
- Thereby the goal is both attained and effective; her insecurity is only abolished when she is with her father.
- Her developed psycho-motor intelligence, her unconsciously active memory combats all feelings of uncertainty with the same aggression, with the adequate expedient, to take refuge in the father as if she were his wife.
- If she recoils from a proffer of love or marriage, threatening her as they do with a fresh lowering of her ego-consciousness, she acts symbolically, and all her defensive resources and her predispositions become arrayed against a female destiny.

**→ Conclusion:** The girl's behavior, driven by a feeling of inferiority and insecurity, is guided by a fiction of becoming her father's wife to attain heightened ego-consciousness and security.

### Argument 23 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Pierre Janet has certainly recognized this relationship as is shown in his classical descriptions of the Hysterical Psyche; 1894.
- Janet expressly maintains, 'I have until now only described general and simple traits of character which by means of their association and under the influence of definite extraneous circumstances may produce all kinds of curious behavior and conduct.'
- Janet, notwithstanding his keen insight into the relationship between the psychology of the neuroses and moral philosophy, never entered the road to synthesis.

**→ Conclusion:** Janet avoided a detailed description and did not fully synthesize the relationship between neurotic traits and broader psychological phenomena.

### Argument 24 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Janet's emphasis of the neurotic's 'sentiment d'incompletude' particularly, is so wholly in harmony with the results offered by me.
- I am justified in seeing in my work an extension of this most important fundamental fact of the mental life of the neurotic.

**→ Conclusion:** My work extends Janet's concept of the neurotic's 'sentiment d'incompletude' as a fundamental aspect of neurotic mental life.

*Source: The Origin and Development of the Feeling of Inferiority | Importance: 6/10*

### Argument 25 (analogical)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Nietzsche's 'Will to power' and 'Will to seem' embrace many of our views.
- These views resemble in some respects the views of Fere and the older writers, according to whom the sensation of pleasure originates in a feeling of power, that of pain in a feeling of feebleness (Ohnmacht).

**→ Conclusion:** The sensation of pleasure and pain in neurosis can be understood through the concepts of power and feebleness, aligning with Nietzsche's and older writers' views.

## Psychic Compensation and Its Synthesis

### Argument 26 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- at the onset of the development of a neurosis there stands threateningly the feeling of uncertainty and inferiority and demands insistently a guiding, assuring and tranquilizing positing of a goal in order to render life bearable
- Among these are especially prominent safety devices and fictions in thought, action and volition

**→ Conclusion:** the feeling of uncertainty and inferiority demands a guiding goal to make life bearable, leading to the creation of safety devices and fictions

*Source: Psychic Compensation and Its Synthesis | Importance: 9/10*

---

### Argument 27 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The neurotic character is thus incapable of adjusting itself to reality because it is always striving toward an impossible ideal
- It is a product and instrument of a cautious psyche which strengthens its guiding principle for the purpose of ridding itself of a feeling of inferiority
- an attempt which is destined to be wrecked as a consequence of inner contradiction, on the barriers of civilization or on the rights of others

**→ Conclusion:** the neurotic character fails to adjust to reality due to striving for an impossible ideal, driven by a cautious psyche attempting to overcome inferiority, but doomed to fail due to contradictions and societal barriers

*Source: Psychic Compensation and Its Synthesis | Importance: 9/10*

---

### Argument 28 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- this sort of psyche, directed as it is with especial force toward a heightening of the ego, will, aside from specific neurotic symptoms, make itself conspicuous in society because of its evident inability to adapt itself
- The consciousness of the weak point dominates the neurotic to such a degree that often without knowing it he begins to construct with all his might the protecting superstructure

**→ Conclusion:** the neurotic psyche's focus on heightening the ego results in an inability to adapt to society due to the construction of a protective superstructure

*Source: Psychic Compensation and Its Synthesis | Importance: 8/10*

---

### Argument 29 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- His mistrust of himself and others, his envy and maliciousness, become gradually more pronounced, aggressive and cruel tendencies which are to secure for him supremacy over his environment, gain the upper hand
- or he endeavors to captivate and conquer others by means of greater obedience, submission and humility which not infrequently degenerate into masochistic traits
- thus both heightened activity as well as increased passivity are expedients ushered in by the fictitious goal of an increased power, of a desire to be above, of the masculine protest

**→ Conclusion:** the neurotic employs both aggressive tendencies and submissive behaviors as expedients to achieve a fictitious goal of increased power and superiority through the masculine protest

*Source: Psychic Compensation and Its Synthesis | Importance: 8/10*

---

### Argument 30 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- All these psychic dexterities, standing as they do in close contact with the outside world, become neurotic only when an inner want accentuates the craving for security
- which in turn more effectively constructs and mobilizes the traits of character only when the fictitious object of life operates more dogmatically and strengthens those secondary guiding principles which are in accord with the traits of character

**→ Conclusion:** psychic dexterities become neurotic due to an inner craving for security amplified by a dogmatic fictitious life goal that strengthens related character traits

*Source: Psychic Compensation and Its Synthesis | Importance: 8/10*

---

### Argument 31 (analogical)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The knowledge of these psychic dexterities, which protrude far and wide, like sensitive antennae, first makes possible the understanding of the neurotic's struggle with his fate, of his stimulated aggressive tendency, his unrest and impatience
- For these antennae test all the phenomena of the environment and examine them constantly for their advantages and disadvantages with regard to the assumed goal
- They create the keen sense for estimate and comparison, awaken, by means of the attention active in them, fear, hope, doubt, expectations of all sorts and seek to ensure the psyche against surprise and against a lowering of the ego-consciousness

**→ Conclusion:** psychic dexterities, functioning as sensitive antennae, enable the understanding of the neurotic's struggle by constantly testing the environment and protecting ego-consciousness

*Source: Psychic Compensation and Its Synthesis | Importance: 7/10*

---

### Argument 32 (comparative)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Freud was obliged to see in this purposeful manifestation a reanimation of infantile wishes because according to him the latter are to be looked upon as motive forces
- We recognize in this infantile mode of procedure, in the extensive use of safety-devices (Hilfsconstructionen), in which light the neurotic fiction is to be regarded, in the many-sided motor preparedness which reaches into the remote past, in the strong tendency to abstraction and symbolization, the most useful expedient of the neurotic, who strives toward security, toward a maximation of his ego, toward the masculine protest

**→ Conclusion:** unlike Freud's view of neurotic behavior as a reanimation of infantile wishes, it is better understood as a useful expedient involving safety devices and fictions aimed at security and ego maximization through the masculine protest

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- Freud's view of neurotic behavior as reanimation of infantile wishes

*Source: Psychic Compensation and Its Synthesis | Importance: 7/10*

---

### Argument 33 (comparative)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- None of the neurotic's traits of character are essentially new
- He shows no single trait which cannot likewise be demonstrated in the healthy individual, although at times it becomes understandable for the physician as well as the patient only through analysis

**→ Conclusion:** neurotic traits of character are not unique and can be found in healthy individuals, though they may require analysis to be understood

*Source: Psychic Compensation and Its Synthesis | Importance: 6/10*

---

### Argument 34 (analogical)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Analogous to the groping gestures, pose in facing the rear, to the bodily attitude in the act of aggression, like mimicry as a form of expression and instrument of motility
- so the traits of character, especially the neurotic ones, serve as a psychic means and form of expression for the purpose of entering into an account with life, for the purpose of assuming an attitude, of gaining a fixed point in the vicissitudes of life, for the purpose of reaching that security-giving goal, the feeling of superiority

**→ Conclusion:** neurotic traits of character serve as psychic means and expressions to engage with life and achieve a security-giving goal of superiority, analogous to physical gestures and mimicry

## The Accentuated Fiction as the Guiding Idea in the Neurosis

### Argument 35 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- This protest arises on the basis of a feeling of inferiority and an effort upon the part of the neurotic to correct this feeling.
- he does by so ordering his life, so regulating his every act that he may find that security of which the feeling of inferiority has robbed him.

**→ Conclusion:** This is the fictitious goal of the neurotic and the fundamental and ultimate cause of his symptoms when he is no longer able to succeed, when failure threatens in his efforts to deal with reality.

*Source: The Accentuated Fiction as the Guiding Idea in the Neurosis | Importance: 10/10*

---

### Argument 36 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- It has not sprung up independently out of any sort of biological or constitutional primitive force, but has received direction and motivation from the compensatory superstructure and the schematic guiding principle.
- Its emergence took place under the pressure of uncertainty, its tendency to personify itself is the doubtful success of the craving for security.
- This course of the neurotic character has received through the positing of a final purpose its destination which is the masculine main principle.

**→ Conclusion:** every neurotic tendency betrays to us by its direction that it is impregnated with the masculine protest which seeks to make of it an unfailing instrument for the purpose of excluding from experience every permanent degradation.

*Source: The Accentuated Fiction as the Guiding Idea in the Neurosis | Importance: 9/10*

---

### Argument 37 (analogical)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- For Adler the neurosis or the psychosis is comparable to the work of art, but has been built up in response to a fictitious goal which collects and unites into a group those psychic elements of which it can make use.
- collecting only those which promise results in the effort at the attainment of security.
- The attempt to attain to the maximation of his ego fails because directed along a false path.

**→ Conclusion:** The neurosis or psychosis is therefore a constructive creation, a compensation product, which, however, fails because of its false direction.

*Source: The Accentuated Fiction as the Guiding Idea in the Neurosis | Importance: 9/10*

---

### Argument 38 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The neurotic constitution founds in an inferior organ.
- the inferior organ produces a feeling of inferiority.
- the feeling of inferiority the masculine protest becomes the fictitious goal of the neurotic.

**→ Conclusion:** whose symptoms result from an effort to mould reality along this fake pathway.

*Source: The Accentuated Fiction as the Guiding Idea in the Neurosis | Importance: 9/10*

---

### Argument 39 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The distinctive feature of Adler's approach to the problem of the neurotic character traits is that it approaches from the organic rather than from the functional side.
- it tends to bring together the organicist and the functionalist, who have been too long separated by the misconception of irreconcilable differences between mind and body.

**→ Conclusion:** Adler's approach to the psychoanalytic problems is admirably calculated to break down such prejudices.

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- No small part of the opposition to the whole psychological movement, as represented in psychoanalysis, has come from the inability of the man who has been brought up to look at things from the point of view of the internist to be able to accept many of the clinical observations which were offered.

*Source: The Accentuated Fiction as the Guiding Idea in the Neurosis | Importance: 8/10*

---

### Argument 40 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The feeling of inferiority, which underlies the masculine protest, has its raison d'etre in an inferior organ.
- In this work he has gone to considerable extent in working over the psychological characteristics of persons who have had demonstrably inferior organs, either clinically evident or showing up at autopsy.

**→ Conclusion:** he believes he has been able to show that the predominant traits of character are the result of an effort on the part of the individual to overcome a feeling of inferiority resulting from an inferior organ.

*Source: The Accentuated Fiction as the Guiding Idea in the Neurosis | Importance: 8/10*

---

### Argument 41 (analogical)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Many examples might be given, and in fact they come within the ken of every one, which demonstrate the validity of this point of view.
- A classical example is that of Demosthenes, a stammerer, who became the greatest orator of Greece.
- Adler believes that defects of this sort nucleate, so to say, the feeling of inferiority and force the individual to make supreme efforts to overcome his particular defect.

**→ Conclusion:** as a result of these efforts, the inferior organ, by the development of a highly differentiated nervous superstructure, may actually become supernormal.

*Source: The Accentuated Fiction as the Guiding Idea in the Neurosis | Importance: 7/10*

---

### Argument 42 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Adler's theories are admirably calculated to help the internist to grasp the possibilities of organ inferiority as they may affect the psyche.
- to help the psychoanalyst to grasp the origin and meanings of the neurosis as he sees it at the psychological level and perhaps to see more clearly upon what his limitations are based.

**→ Conclusion:** the two groups of physicians, heretofore separated all too far, both in theory and practice, may find in Adler's views a common ground upon which to meet.

*Source: The Accentuated Fiction as the Guiding Idea in the Neurosis | Importance: 7/10*

### Argument 43 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- To those who follow Adler through the various ramifications of his hypothesis, who read sympathetically his numerous case reports which he offers to substantiate his views.
- the angle from which he looks at the problem of the neuroses and the psychoses lets us see new aspects of these phenomena.

**→ Conclusion:** there can be no doubt but that the angle from which he looks at the problem of the neuroses and the psychoses lets us see new aspects of these phenomena which are exceedingly helpful to us in our effort to grasp their meanings.

## Practical Part: Neurotic Traits and Their Manifestations

### Argument 44 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- the realization of somatic inferiority by the individual becomes for him a permanent impelling force for the development of his psyche
- Physiologically there results from this a reenforcement of the nerve tracts, both quantitatively and qualitatively, whereby a concomitant original inferiority of these tracts is enabled to reveal in a composite picture its tectonic and functional peculiarities
- The psychic phase of this compensation and overcompensation can only be disclosed by means of psychologic investigation and analysis

**→ Conclusion:** somatic inferiority by the individual becomes for him a permanent impelling force for the development of his psyche

*Source: Practical Part: Neurotic Traits and Their Manifestations | Importance: 9/10*

---

### Argument 45 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- One may easily detect in every instance from observation of the child and from the anamneses of the adult that the possession of definitely inferior organs is reflected upon the psyche
- in such a way as to lower the self-esteem, to raise the child's psychological uncertainty
- but it is just out of this lowered self-esteem that there arises the struggle for self-assertion which assumes forms much more intense than one would expect

**→ Conclusion:** the possession of definitely inferior organs is reflected upon the psyche and in such a way as to lower the self-esteem, to raise the child's psychological uncertainty; but it is just out of this lowered self-esteem that there arises the struggle for self-assertion

*Source: Practical Part: Neurotic Traits and Their Manifestations | Importance: 8/10*

---

### Argument 46 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- As the compensated inferior organ gains in the scope of activity both qualitatively and quantitatively and acquires protective means from itself as well as from the entire organism
- the predisposed child in his sense of inferiority selects out of his psychic resources expedients for the raising of his own value which are frequently striking in nature
- among which may be noted as occupying the most prominent places those of a neurotic and psychotic character

**→ Conclusion:** the predisposed child in his sense of inferiority selects out of his psychic resources expedients for the raising of his own value which are frequently striking in nature and among which may be noted as occupying the most prominent places those of a neurotic and psychotic character

### Argument 47 (definitional)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- organ-inferiority, as described by me, includes the incompleteness in such organs, the frequently demonstrable arrests of development or functional maturity, the functional failure in the postfetal period and the fetal character of organs and systems of organs
- on the other hand the accentuation of their developmental tendency in the presence of compensatory and coordinating forces and the frequent bringing about of increased functional activity

**→ Conclusion:** organ-inferiority includes both developmental deficits and compensatory tendencies leading to increased functional activity

### Argument 48 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Freud who assumes a sexual constitution as the basis of the neuroses and psychoses, under which term he understands a qualitatively and quantitatively varying arrangement of partial sex impulses
- The development of perverse inclinations and their unsuccessful repression into the unconscious furnishes, according to him, the picture of the neurosis, and in itself forms the primary cause for the neurotic psyche

**→ Conclusion:** perversion so far as it reaches development in the neurosis and psychosis is not dependent upon a connate impulse, but that it arises from the striving towards a fictitious goal in connection with which the repression takes place as a by-product under the pressure of the self-consciousness

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- Freud's assumption of sexual constitution as the basis of neuroses and psychoses

**Premises:**
- This fetal character, however, at the same time furnishes the increased possibility for compensation and overcompensation
- increases the adaptability to ordinary and extraordinary resistances
- assures the attainment of new and higher forms, new and higher accomplishments

**→ Conclusion:** the inferior organs furnish the inexhaustible material by means of which the organism continuously seeks to reach a better accord with the altered conditions of life through adaptation, repudiation, and improvement

### Argument 50 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- With the release from the maternal organism there begins for these inferior organs or systems of organs the struggle with the outside world, which must of necessity ensue
- which is initiated with greater vehemence than in the more normally developed apparatus
- This struggle is accompanied by greater mortality and morbidity rates

**→ Conclusion:** This struggle is accompanied by greater mortality and morbidity rates

### Argument 51 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- the simultaneously existing organ-inferiorities stand in relation to one another as if united by a secret bond
- Kyrle, too, supporting himself by the newly discovered pathological findings, reached quite independently conclusions identical with mine
- namely, that the coordination of the inferiority of the sexual apparatus with other organ-inferiorities, though frequently only slightly developed, is nevertheless so often found to exist

**→ Conclusion:** there exist no organ-inferiorities without an accompanying defect in the sexual apparatus

### Argument 52 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The evils of constitutional inferiority manifest themselves in the most varied diseases and predispositions to disease
- At times various somatic or mental disabilities develop, at other times an over-irritability of the nerve tracts, then again clumsiness of manner, ungainliness, precocity
- A host of childhood defects cooperate with the predisposition to disease and form a close union

**→ Conclusion:** constitutional inferiority manifests itself in varied diseases, disabilities, and behavioral traits in childhood and beyond

## The Role of Fiction in Neurotic Behavior

### Argument 53 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The neurotic individual is derived from this sphere of uncertainty and in his childhood is under the pressure of his constitutional inferiority.
- In most cases this may be easily detected; in other cases the patient behaves as if he were inferior.
- In all cases, however, his striving and thinking are built upon the foundation of the feeling of inferiority.
- This feeling must always be understood in a relative sense, as the outgrowth of the individual's relation to his environment or to his strivings.

**→ Conclusion:** The neurotic individual's behavior and thought processes are fundamentally shaped by the feeling of inferiority, which arises from their relation to their environment and personal strivings.

### Argument 54 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- I showed how the inferior organ constantly endeavors to make a very special demand upon the interest and attention.
- I was able to prove to what extent inferiority of an organ constantly shows its influence on the psyche in action, in thought, in dreams, in the choice of a vocation and in artistic inclinations and capabilities.

**→ Conclusion:** Inferiority of an organ has a significant influence on the psyche, manifesting in various aspects of life.

### Argument 55 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The constitutionally inferior child, the unattractive child, the child too strictly reared, the pampered child, all of whom we may align as being predisposed to the development of a neurosis, seek more diligently than does the normal child to avoid the evils of their existence.
- They soon long to banish into a distant future the fate which confronts them.
- In order to bring this about, he, the defective child, requires an expedient which enables him to keep before.

**→ Conclusion:** Children predisposed to neurosis due to constitutional inferiority or upbringing actively seek ways to escape or mitigate their perceived negative circumstances through psychological expedients.

### Argument 56 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The concept of degeneracy has become of increasing importance to neurology and psychiatry.
- The line of advance stretches all the way from Morel's theory of the stigmata of degeneration to the consideration of nervous diseases from the standpoint of an inferior constitution.
- Statistical studies like Thiemich-Birks and Potpeschnigg's contributions concerning children treated for tetanoid convulsions show that only a small number became entirely well, with most showing later signs of somatic and psychic inferiority, psychopathic and neuropathic characteristics such as infantilism, squints, difficulty of hearing, speech defects, feeble-mindedness, and others.

**→ Conclusion:** There exists a predisposition to severe neurotic and psychopathic states in spasmophilic children.

### Argument 57 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The existence of an inferior organ demands a kind of training on the part of the appertaining nerve tracts and on the part of the psychic superstructure which would render the latter active in a compensatory manner when a possibility for compensation exists.
- We must likewise find a reenforcement in the psychic superstructure of certain allied points of contact which the inferior organ has with the outside world.
- To the originally inferior organ of vision corresponds a reenforced visual psyche; a defective digestive apparatus will be accompanied by a greater psychic capability in all nutritional directions, as gourmondism, acquisitiveness, and where it concerns money equivalents, stinginess and greed, will be manifested to an extraordinary degree.

**→ Conclusion:** The psychic superstructure compensates for organ inferiority by enhancing related psychic capabilities and behaviors.

### Argument 58 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- He has constantly been drawing comparisons between himself and others, at first with his father, as the strongest in the family, sometimes with his mother, his brothers and sisters, later with every person with whom he comes into contact.
- Upon closer analysis, one finds that every child, especially the one less favored by nature, has made a careful estimate of his own value.

**→ Conclusion:** Feelings of inferiority in children, particularly those constitutionally inferior, arise from constant comparisons with others and self-evaluation.

### Argument 59 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Czerny and others maintain that a similar relationship may be found in children suffering from gastro-intestinal disorders.
- Bartel discovered among suicides a considerable preponderance of the status thymicolymphaticus, especially a hypoplasia of the sexual organs.
- The existence of somatic inferiority among juvenile suicides was shown by me, Netslitzky and others.

**→ Conclusion:** There is a relationship between somatic inferiority and neurotic or psychopathic states, including suicidal tendencies.

### Argument 60 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- French writers ascribe to the torpid habitus of children, moroseness, indolence, sleepiness, distractibility, stupidity and phlegmatism, and to the erotistic type, restlessness, liveliness, irritability, precocity, moodiness, affectivity, unsociability, peculiarity of disposition and one-sided development.
- Pfaundler emphasizes the harassing, tormenting and painful influences to which defective children are subject as a result of skin eruptions, colic, disturbances of sleep and functional anomalies.

**→ Conclusion:** Constitutional inferiority in children leads to specific psychic and behavioral characteristics that impact their mental health.

### Argument 61 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The compensating psychic superstructure will bring about an accentuated manifestation of the psychic phenomena of presentiments and forethoughts and their effective factors such as memory, intuition, introspection, analysis, attention, hypersensitiveness, in brief, of all the fortifying psychic forces.
- To these reassuring forces belong also the fixation and accentuation of those traits which form useful guiding principles in the chaos of life, thus diminishing the feeling of uncertainty.

**→ Conclusion:** The compensating psychic superstructure enhances fortifying psychic forces and guiding principles to reduce feelings of uncertainty in life.

## The Influence of Childhood Experiences

### Argument 62 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- He sums up in his self-estimation all evils, considers himself incompetent, inferior, degraded, insecure.
- And in order to find a guiding principle he takes as a second fixed point his father or mother who endowed him with all the attributes of life.
- And in adjusting this guiding principle to his thinking and acting, in his endeavors to raise himself to the level of his (all-powerful) father, even to the point of surpassing the latter, he has quite removed himself with one mighty bound from reality and is suspended in the meshes of a fiction.

**→ Conclusion:** He has quite removed himself with one mighty bound from reality and is suspended in the meshes of a fiction.

### Argument 63 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- All later trains of thought and activities of the neurotic are constructed similarly with his childhood wish phantasy.
- The 'recurrence of the identical' (Nietzsche) is nowhere so well illustrated as in the neurotic.
- His feeling of inferiority in the presence of men and things, his uncertainty in the world force him to an accentuation of his guiding principles.

**→ Conclusion:** The neurotic's later thoughts and activities are constructed similarly to childhood wish fantasies, driven by feelings of inferiority and uncertainty, leading to an accentuation of guiding principles.

### Argument 64 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- To these [guiding principles] he clings throughout life in order to orient himself in existence by means of his beliefs and superstitions, in order to overcome his feeling of inferiority, in order to rescue his sense of egoconsciousness, in order to possess a subterfuge to avoid a much dreaded degradation.
- Never has he succeeded so well in this as during his childhood.
- His guiding fiction which makes him behave as if he surpassed all others may therefore also bring about a form of conduct identical with that of the child.

**→ Conclusion:** The neurotic clings to guiding principles throughout life to overcome inferiority and avoid degradation, often reverting to childhood behaviors through guiding fictions.

### Argument 65 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- In the temporary denials and discomforts which the first years of childhood bring with them, one must seek the impulse for the development of a host of common traits of character.
- Above all the child learns, in his weakness and helplessness, in his anxiety and manifold shortcomings to value an expedient which assures him of the help and support of his relatives and guarantees their concern.

**→ Conclusion:** The temporary denials and discomforts of early childhood are the impulse for developing common character traits, particularly the reliance on expedients for support from relatives.

### Argument 66 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The awakening self-consciousness is always being suppressed in constitutionally inferior children, their self-esteem is lowered because their capacity for gratification is much more limited.
- Let us consider the numerous restrictions, the courses of treatment and the sufferings of children ill with gastro-intestinal derangements; the effeminacy and fastidiousness seen in the anaemic, weakly children suffering from respiratory disorders; the itching and tortures of those afflicted with prurigo and other exanthemata; the many degrading defects of childhood.
- The fear of contamination on the part of the parents of such children which often leads, as do the frequent difficulties in their bringing up in their school progress as well as the stubbornness of these children to an isolation and misunderstanding on the part of their comrades and within the family circle.

**→ Conclusion:** Constitutionally inferior children experience suppressed self-consciousness and lowered self-esteem due to physical limitations and social isolation caused by parental fears and peer misunderstandings.

### Argument 67 (analogical)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Similar observations may also be made in a lesser degree among normal children.
- They too desire to be great, to be strong, to rule as the father, and are guided by this objective.
- Their conduct, their psychical and physical attitude is constantly directed towards this goal, so that one may almost detect a true imitation, an identical psychic gesture.

**→ Conclusion:** Normal children also exhibit a desire to imitate and achieve the 'masculine goal' of being great and strong like their father.

*Source: The Influence of Childhood Experiences | Importance: 7/10*

---

### Argument 68 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- In his negativistic behavior, in his obstinacy and refractoriness, he often finds a gratification of his consciousness of his own powers, thus ridding himself of the painful realization of his inferiority.
- Both mainsprings of the child's behavior, obstinacy and obedience guarantee to him an accentuation of his feeling of ego-consciousness and assist him in groping his way towards the masculine goal or, as we wished to adduce before, towards the equivalent of this.

**→ Conclusion:** Negativistic behavior and obstinacy in children provide gratification of their sense of power, reducing feelings of inferiority and aiding in pursuit of the masculine goal.

*Source: The Influence of Childhood Experiences | Importance: 7/10*

---

### Argument 69 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The child usually explains his difficulty by the assumption of a neglect, a slight by the parents, especially as it occurs in later children or in the youngest, occasionally even in the first born.
- This hostile aggression, reenforced and accentuated in constitutionally inferior children, becomes confluent with his effort to become as great and strong as the strongest and thrusts forward activities which lie at the bottom of the infantile ambition.

**→ Conclusion:** Children, especially constitutionally inferior ones, attribute their difficulties to parental neglect, fueling hostile aggression and driving infantile ambition to become as great and strong as others.

### Argument 70 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Should the idea of 'the masculine goal' become unacceptable to girls, then there takes place a change of form of this 'masculine' guiding principle.
- One can scarcely evaluate this phenomenon in a more correct way than by assuming that the necessary denial of the gratification of certain organic functions forces the child from the first hour of his extrauterine life into assuming a combative attitude towards his environment.

**→ Conclusion:** For girls, the 'masculine goal' changes form due to the denial of certain organic gratifications, leading to a combative attitude towards the environment.

### Argument 71 (analogical)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- It would be amiss to assume that only the neurotic exhibits such 'guiding principles.'
- The healthy individual would also have to do without orientation in the world if he did not arrange the cosmic picture and his experience according to some imaginary fiction.
- In hours of uncertainty these fictions come to the fore more distinctly and become the imperative influences dominating beliefs, ideals and free will; moreover they also act secretly.

**→ Conclusion:** Healthy individuals also rely on guiding fictions to orient themselves in the world, especially in times of uncertainty, similar to neurotics.

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- It would be amiss to assume that only the neurotic exhibits such 'guiding principles.'

## The Neurotic's Struggle for Superiority

### Argument 72 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The neurotic carries his feeling of inferiority constantly with him.
- Hence his method of thinking by analogy is more strongly and clearly developed.
- His 'misoneism' (Lombroso), his fear of the new, of decisions and tests, which is usually present, originates from the lack of analogy for these new conditions.

**→ Conclusion:** He has chained himself so strongly to guiding principles, taken them so literally and sought to realize them only, that unconsciously he has become incapable of proceeding freely and without prejudice to the solution of real problems.

*Source: The Neurotic's Struggle for Superiority | Importance: 9/10*

### Argument 73 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- All the phenomena of the neuroses originate from these predisposing means which tend toward the attainment of the final object, masculinity.
- They are mental predispositions always ready to initiate the struggle for ego-consciousness.
- They obey the command of the guiding principle which seeks to realize itself through the channels of reactions lying ready at hand in childhood.

**→ Conclusion:** In the developed neuroses the fiction stimulates all these predispositions whereupon they comport themselves as independent final purposes.

*Source: The Neurotic's Struggle for Superiority | Importance: 9/10*

---

### Argument 74 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The form and content of the neurotic 'guiding principle' originate from the impressions of the child who feels himself neglected.
- These impressions, which of necessity develop out of an original sense of inferiority, call forth an aggressive attitude in life.
- The object of which is the overcoming of the uncertainty.

**→ Conclusion:** In this attitude of aggression all those efforts of the child which tend toward an elevation of his feeling of ego-consciousness find their place.

*Source: The Neurotic's Struggle for Superiority | Importance: 8/10*

---

### Argument 75 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Anxiety, which formerly sought to furnish assurance against being alone, against underestimation, against the feeling of insignificance, is hypostasized.
- The compulsion, originally in the sense of the fiction to preserve a manly behavior, becomes independent.
- In fainting, in paralysis, in the hysterical pains and functional disturbances, the pseudo-masochistic method of the patient is symbolically represented, in which he seeks to attract attention or to avoid a decision which is feared.

**→ Conclusion:** The important role played by the neurotic uncertainty, as I have recognized and described it, leads to that sort of strengthening of the predisposition and its consequences which makes the originally unimportant phenomena of a functional nature assume the most astonishing exaggeration as soon as the inner exigency demands it.

*Source: The Neurotic's Struggle for Superiority | Importance: 7/10*

---

### Argument 76 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The gaze of the neurotic, on account of this feeling of uncertainty, is directed far into the future.
- All present existence is to him only a preparation.

**→ Conclusion:** Moreover this circumstance is largely responsible for encouraging his dreaming proclivities and estranging him from the world of reality.

*Source: The Neurotic's Struggle for Superiority | Importance: 7/10*

### Argument 77 (analogical)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- As with religious persons his kingdom is not of this world.
- Like them he cannot free himself from his self-created deity, the exaltation of his ego-consciousness.

**→ Conclusion:** A host of general traits of character of necessity develop in an individual thus turned away from reality.

*Source: The Neurotic's Struggle for Superiority | Importance: 6/10*

---

### Argument 78 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- An individual of this type will as a rule manifest a carefully adjusted mode of behavior, exactness and pedantry, first of all, in order not to increase the great difficulties of life.
- Secondly and principally, in order to distinguish himself from others in dress, in work, in morals, and thus acquire for himself a feeling of superiority.

**→ Conclusion:** This exaggerated trait of character usually serves also to bring him face to face with the enemy, to furnish the opportunity for a maturing of such situations as will bring him into conflict with his environment so that he finds occasion for giving vent to reproaches.

*Source: The Neurotic's Struggle for Superiority | Importance: 6/10*

---

### Argument 79 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The psychic phenomena of anxiety originate from an hallucinatory excitation of a predisposition which in childhood developed automatically from small beginnings as soon as a bodily injury was threatened.
- Which in later life, especially in the neuroses, is conditioned by the final goal, namely, to escape a lowering of ego-consciousness and to make oneself of service to others.

**→ Conclusion:** It is easy to understand how all wishphantasies may attain an enormous degree, just as attainment seldom brings with it satisfaction.

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- In spite of all other attempts at explanation

### Argument 80 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- This trait may be found even in the childhood of certain neurotics where it serves the purpose of putting some one at their service, say the mother, who must take care of their clothes every evening for a considerable length of time in a definitely prescribed manner.

**→ Conclusion:** At the same time these constant reproaches serve to keep alive his feeling, his attention, to the fact that people are neglecting him, that they are not taking him into account.

### Argument 81 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- One may assume without fear of contradiction that a neurotic 'wishes to have everything.'

**→ Conclusion:** This desire coincides with his 'guiding fiction to become potent.'

## Conclusion and Implications for Therapy

### Argument 82 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- It matters but little how much of this driving force becomes consciously known to the neurotic.
- The mechanism itself he never understands, neither is he able to explain and break down unaided his mode of apperception by means of analogy and the conduct resulting therefrom.

**→ Conclusion:** This can only succeed by means of an analytic process which permits us to divine and understand his infantile analogy by means of abstraction, reduction and simplification.

*Source: Conclusion and Implications for Therapy | Importance: 10/10*

---

### Argument 83 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- As the driving force and goal of the neurosis developing out of a constitutional inferiority, we have up to this point regarded the accentuation of ego-consciousness which constantly strives for expression with especial force.
- In doing so we have not ignored the fact that this is only a mode of expression of a striving and yearning whose beginnings are deeply rooted in human nature.
- The form of expression itself and the accentuation of this guiding thought, which may also be expressed by Nietzsche's 'will to power,' teaches us that there is an especial compensatory force at play, whose object it is to put an end to the inner uncertainty.

**→ Conclusion:** By means of an unyielding formula, which usually presses to the surface of consciousness, the neurotic seeks to obtain the fulcrum whereby to lift the world off its hinges.

*Source: Conclusion and Implications for Therapy | Importance: 9/10*

### Argument 84 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- before undertakings which promise advantage, as he usually does before crimes and immoral acts, it is because he entertains fears for the safety of his ego-consciousness.
- For this reason he recoils in horror from lying, but in order to proceed with certainty and in order to preserve steadfastness he may harbor the thought that he is capable of great evils and crimes.

**→ Conclusion:** That this obstinate pursuit of the fiction implies a social injury is obvious.

*Source: Conclusion and Implications for Therapy | Importance: 8/10*

### Argument 85 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The further the analysis proceeds the more distinct appears one of these opposites, the original form of which we have established as the feeling of inferiority and the maximation of the ego-consciousness.
- This only agrees with the primitive efforts of the child to orient himself in the world and to obtain certainty when tangible antitheses are encountered.
- Among these I have regularly found the following: (1). Above beneath. (2). Masculine feminine.
- One furthermore always finds an arrangement of memories, feelings and actions according to this type of antitheses in the sense the patient takes them (not always in the generally accepted sense), i.e., inferior beneath, feminine; powerful above, masculine.

**→ Conclusion:** This grouping is important for it renders possible, because it can be conserved or falsified at will, the distortion of the cosmic picture, whereby the neurotic can always hold fast to his standpoint, namely, that of a neglected person, by rearrangement, by accentuation or by arbitrary changes.

*Source: Conclusion and Implications for Therapy | Importance: 8/10*

### Argument 86 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The egoism of neurotics, their envy, their greed, frequently unconscious, their tendency to undervalue men and things, originate in their feeling of uncertainty.
- These traits serve the purpose of assuring them, of guiding them and of spurring them on.
- As they are enveloped in phantasy and live in the future, their preoccupation is not to be wondered at.

**→ Conclusion:** The variability of temper depends on the play of the phantasy which at one time awakens painful memories, at another fills with the enthusiasm of an expected triumph, analogous to the vacillations and doubts of the neurotic.

*Source: Conclusion and Implications for Therapy | Importance: 7/10*

---

### Argument 87 (analogical)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- In this way one finds regularly apparent that the neurotic always apperceives after the analogy of a contrast, indeed, that usually he only recognizes and gives value to relations of contrast.
- This primitive mode of orientation in life which corresponds to the antithesis as set forth in the categories of Aristotle and to opposites in the Pythagorean table originates also in the feeling of uncertainty and illustrates a simple device of logic.
- What I have described as polar, hermaphroditic opposites, Lombroso as bipolar, Bleuler as ambivalent, leads to this same method of apperception which works according to the principal of opposites.

**→ Conclusion:** One should not fall into the common error of regarding this as an essence of things, but must recognize in it the primitive method of procedure which measures a thing, a force, or an event, by an opposite which is fitted to it.

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- One should not fall into the common error of regarding this as an essence of things

*Source: Conclusion and Implications for Therapy | Importance: 7/10*

### Argument 88 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Sexual precocity and falling in love are forms of expression for the heightened tendency to captivate.
- Masturbation, impotence and perverse excitements lie in the direction of the guiding line of fear of a partner and fear of separation.
- Along with which sadism represents the desire to play the 'wild man' in order to overcome the feeling of inferiority.

**→ Conclusion:** Special traits of character which are not foreign to the normal psyche appear to be directed by the hypnotizing goal and strengthened in this direction.

*Source: Conclusion and Implications for Therapy | Importance: 6/10*

---

### Argument 89 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- It lies in the nature of things that in this process his constitutional inferiority comes to his assistance.
- His constantly increasing aggressive environment which is continually set against him also aids in this distortion.

**→ Conclusion:** The neurotic can always hold fast to his standpoint, namely, that of a neglected person, by rearrangement, by accentuation or by arbitrary changes.
