## The Meaning of Life

### Argument 9 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Among these varieties, however, we can distinguish some which answer better and some which answer worse; some where the mistake is small and some where it is large.
- We can discover what it is that the better meanings share in common, what it is that the worse meanings lack.

**→ Conclusion:** In this way we can obtain a scientific 'meaning of life', a common measure of true meanings, a meaning which enables us to meet reality in so far as it concerns mankind.

### Argument 10 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Human beings live in the realm of meanings. We do not experience pure circumstances; we always experience circumstances in their significance for men.
- Even at its source our experience is qualified by our human purposes.
- We experience reality always through the meaning we give it; not in itself, but as something interpreted.

**→ Conclusion:** No human being can escape meanings.

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- If a man should try to escape meanings and devote himself only to circumstances he would be very unfortunate: he would isolate himself from others: his actions would be useless to himself or to any one; in a word, they would be meaningless.

### Argument 11 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Every human being has three main ties; and it is of these ties that he must take account.
- They make up reality for him. All the problems which confront him are in the direction of these ties.
- He must always answer these problems because they are always questioning him.

**→ Conclusion:** The answers will show us his individual conception of the meaning of life.

### Argument 12 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Individual Psychology has found no problems in life which cannot be grouped under these three main problems—occupational, social and sexual.
- These three ties set three problems: how to find an occupation which will enable us to survive under the limitations set by the nature of the earth; how to find a position among our fellows, so that we may cooperate and share the benefits of cooperation; how to accommodate ourselves to the fact that we live in two sexes and that the continuance and furtherance of mankind depends upon our love-life.

**→ Conclusion:** It is in his response to these three problems that every individual human being unfailingly reveals his own deep sense of the meaning of life.

### Argument 13 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- If we asked a man, 'What is the meaning of life?', he would perhaps be unable to answer.
- For the most part people do not bother themselves with the question or try to formulate replies.
- It is in his actions that every man inevitably puts the question and answers it.
- If we close our ears to his words and observe his actions, we shall find that he has his own individual 'meaning of life' and that all his postures, attitudes, movements, expressions, mannerisms, ambitions, habits and character traits accord with this meaning.

**→ Conclusion:** He behaves as if he could rely upon a certain interpretation of life.

*Source: The Meaning of Life | Importance: 8/10*

---

### Argument 14 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The first of these ties is that we are living on the crust of this poor planet, earth, and nowhere else.
- We must develop under the restrictions and with the possibilities which our place of habitation sets us.
- In body and mind alike we must develop so that we can continue our personal lives on earth and help to insure the future continuance of mankind.

**→ Conclusion:** This is one problem which challenges every man for an answer; which no individual can escape.

*Source: The Meaning of Life | Importance: 8/10*

### Argument 15 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The second tie is that we are not the only members of the human race. There are others around us, and we are living in association with them.
- The weakness and the limits of the individual human being make it impossible for him to ensure his own aims in isolation.
- If he lived alone and tried to meet his problems by himself he would perish. He would not be able to continue his own life; he would not be able to continue the life of mankind.

**→ Conclusion:** The greatest step for his own welfare and for the welfare of mankind is association.

### Argument 16 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- There are as many meanings given to life as there are human beings.
- Perhaps each meaning involves more or less of a mistake.
- No one possesses the absolute meaning of life.
- Any meaning which is at all serviceable cannot be called absolutely wrong.

**→ Conclusion:** All meanings are varieties between these two limits.

### Argument 17 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- There is a third tie in which we are bound. Human beings are living in two sexes.
- The preservation of individual and of common life must take account of this fact.
- The problem of love and marriage belongs to this third tie.

**→ Conclusion:** No man or woman can escape giving an answer.

*Source: The Meaning of Life | Importance: 7/10*

### Argument 18 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Suppose, for example, we consider a man whose love life is incomplete, who makes no efforts in his profession, who has few friends and who finds contact with his fellows painful.
- From the limits and restrictions of his life we may conclude that he feels being alive as a difficult and dangerous thing, offering few opportunities and many defeats.

**→ Conclusion:** His narrow field of action is to be construed as a judgment, 'Life means – to preserve myself against hurt, to stockade myself in, to escape untouched.'

*Source: The Meaning of Life | Importance: 6/10*

### Argument 19 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Suppose, on the other hand, we consider a man whose love-life is an intimate and many-sided cooperation, whose work results in useful achievements, whose friends are many and whose contacts with his fellows are wide and fruitful.

**→ Conclusion:** Of such a man we may conclude that he feels life as a creative task, offering many opportunities and no irrecoverable defeats.

## Mind and Body

### Argument 20 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- life is to be construed as a judgment, 'Life means — to be interested in my fellow men, to be part of the whole, to contribute my share to the welfare of mankind.'
- All failures — neurotics, psychotics, criminals, drunkards, problem children, suicides, perverts and prostitutes — are failures because they are lacking in fellow-feeling and social interest.
- They approach the problems of occupation, friendship and sex without the confidence that they can be solved by cooperation.
- The meaning they give to life is a private meaning: no one else is benefited by the achievement of their aims and their interest stops short at their own persons.

**→ Conclusion:** A private meaning is in fact no meaning at all.

*Source: Mind and Body | Importance: 10/10*

---

### Argument 21 (analogical)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Meaning is only possible in communication: a word which meant something to one person only would really be meaningless.
- It is the same with our aims and actions; their only meaning is their meaning for others.
- Every human being strives for significance; but people always make mistakes if they do not see that their whole significance must consist in their contribution to the lives of others.

**→ Conclusion:** The meaning of life is interest in others and cooperation.

*Source: Mind and Body | Importance: 10/10*

---

### Argument 22 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The mark of all true 'meanings of life' is that they are common meanings — they are meanings in which others can share, and meanings which others can accept as valid.
- A good solution of the problems of life will always clear the way for others also; for in it we shall see common problems met in a successful way.
- Even genius is to be defined as no more than supreme usefulness: it is only when a man's life is recognized by others as having significance for them that we call him a genius.

**→ Conclusion:** The meaning expressed in such a life will always be, 'Life means — to contribute to the whole.'

*Source: Mind and Body | Importance: 9/10*

---

### Argument 23 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Some people may doubt whether the meaning we give to life should really be contribution, interest in others and cooperation.
- They will ask, perhaps, 'But what about the individual? If he is always considering other people and devoting himself to their interests, does not his own individuality suffer?'
- They may also ask, 'Is it not necessary, for some individuals at least, that if they are to develop properly they should consider themselves?'
- This view, I believe, is a great mistake, and the problem it raises is a false problem.
- If a human being, in the meaning he gives to life, wishes to make a contribution, and if his emotions are all directed to this goal, he will naturally be bound to bring himself into the best shape for contribution.
- He will fit himself for his goal; he will train himself in social feeling and he will gain skill from practice.

**→ Conclusion:** Granted the goal, the training will follow. Then and then only will he begin to equip himself to solve the three problems of life and to develop his abilities.

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- Some may argue that focusing on others neglects individuality and personal development.

### Argument 24 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- No experience is a cause of success or failure.
- We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences — the so-called trauma — but we make out of them just what suits our purposes.
- We are self-determined by the meaning we give to our experiences; and there is probably something of a mistake always involved when we take particular experiences as the basis for our future life.

**→ Conclusion:** Meanings are not determined by situations, but we determine ourselves by the meanings we give to situations.

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- Some may believe that experiences or traumas directly cause success or failure.

*Source: Mind and Body | Importance: 8/10*

### Argument 25 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- If we look around us to-day at the heritage we have received from our ancestors, what do we see? All that survives of them is the contributions they have made to human life.
- We see cultivated ground; we see roadways and buildings; we see the communicated results of their experience of life, in traditions, in philosophies, in the sciences and the arts, in the technique of dealing with our human situations.
- These results have all been left by men who contributed to human welfare.
- What has happened to others? What has happened to those who never cooperated, who gave life a different meaning, who asked only, 'What can I get out of life?' They have left no trace behind them.

**→ Conclusion:** The last judgment for people who give any other meaning to life than cooperation is always, 'You are useless. Nobody wants you. Go!'

### Argument 26 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- There are certain situations in childhood from which a gravely mistaken meaning is very frequently drawn.
- First we must take children with imperfect organs, suffering from diseases or infirmities during their infancy.
- Such children are overburdened, and it will be difficult for them to feel that the meaning of life is contribution.
- Unless there is someone near them who can draw their attention away from themselves and interest them in others, they are likely to occupy themselves mainly with their own sensations.
- Later on, they may become discouraged by comparing themselves with those around them, and it may even happen, in our present civilization, that their feelings of inferiority are stressed by the pity, ridicule or avoidance of their fellows.

**→ Conclusion:** It is from children in these situations that the majority of failures come.

*Source: Mind and Body | Importance: 7/10*

---

### Argument 27 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- From the first days of childhood we can see dark gropings after this 'meaning of life.'
- Even a baby is striving to make an estimate of its own powers and its share in the whole life which surrounds it.
- By the end of the fifth year of life a child has reached a unified and crystallized pattern of behavior, its own style of approach to problems and tasks.
- It has already fixed its deepest and most lasting conception of what to expect from the world and from itself.

**→ Conclusion:** From now on, the world is seen through a stable scheme of apperception: experiences are interpreted before they are accepted, and the interpretation always accords with the original meaning given to life.

## Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority

### Argument 28 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- These three situations imperfect organs, pampering, and neglect are a great challenge to give a mistaken meaning to life.
- Children from these situations will almost always need help in revising their approach to problems.

**→ Conclusion:** They must be helped to a better meaning.

*Source: Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority | Importance: 10/10*

---

### Argument 29 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- I was the first person, I think, to describe the difficulties that confront a child whose organs are imperfect or whose glandular secretions are abnormal.
- No imperfection of organs compels a mistaken style of life.
- We never find two children whose glands have the same effects on them.
- We can often see children who overcome these difficulties and who, in overcoming them, develop unusual faculties for usefulness.

**→ Conclusion:** From the body we cannot judge whether the development of the mind will be bad or good.

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- From the beginning I was seeking a method of overcoming these difficulties, and not a ground for throwing the responsibility for failure upon heredity or physical condition.

*Source: Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority | Importance: 9/10*

---

### Argument 30 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The pampered child is trained to expect that his wishes will be treated as laws.
- He is granted prominence without working to deserve it and he will generally come to feel this prominence as a birthright.
- When he comes into circumstances where he is not the center of attention and where other people do not make it their chief aim to consider his feelings, he will be very much at a loss: he will feel that his world has failed him.
- He has been trained to expect and not to give.
- He has never learned any other way of facing problems.
- Others have been so subservient to him that he has lost his independence and does not know that he can do things for himself.

**→ Conclusion:** His interest was devoted to himself and he never learned the use and the necessity of cooperation.

*Source: Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority | Importance: 9/10*

---

### Argument 31 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The neglected child has never known what love and cooperation can be: he makes up an interpretation of life which does not include these friendly forces.
- When he faces the problems of life he will overrate their difficulty and underrate his own capacity to meet them with the aid and good will of others.
- He has found society cold to him and he will expect it always to be cold.
- Especially he will not see that he can win affection and esteem by actions which are useful to others.

**→ Conclusion:** He will thus be suspicious of others and unable to trust himself.

*Source: Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority | Importance: 9/10*

---

### Argument 32 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Many of the most eminent men, men who made great contributions to our culture, began with imperfect organs; often their health was poor and sometimes they died early.
- It is mainly from those people who struggled hard against difficulties, in body as in outer circumstances, that advances and new contributions have come.
- The struggle strengthened them and they went further ahead.

**→ Conclusion:** In this way Individual Psychology is not a very good advertisement for schemes of eugenic selection.

### Argument 33 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- When he has difficulties before him, he has only one method of meeting them   to make demands on other people.
- It seems to him that if he can regain his position of prominence, if he can force others to recognize that he is a special person and should be granted everything he wants, then and then only will his situation improve.

**→ Conclusion:** These grown-up pampered children are perhaps the most dangerous class in our community.

*Source: Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority | Importance: 8/10*

---

### Argument 34 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Every memory, however trivial he may think it, represents to him something memorable.
- It is memorable because of its bearing on life as he pictures it; it says to him, 'This is what you must expect', or 'This is what you must avoid', or 'Such is life!'
- The memories of early childhood are especially useful in showing how long standing is the individual's own peculiar approach to life, and in giving the circumstances in which he first crystallized his life-attitude.

**→ Conclusion:** The greatest of all helps, however, in gaining a quick comprehension of the meaning an individual gives to himself and to life comes through his memories.

*Source: Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority | Importance: 8/10*

---

### Argument 35 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Hitherto, however, the greatest part of children who started with imperfect organs and imperfect glands have not been trained in the right direction; their difficulties have not been understood.
- They have mainly become interested in their own persons.

**→ Conclusion:** It is for this reason that we find such a great number of failures amongst those children whose early years were burdened with imperfect organs.

*Source: Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority | Importance: 7/10*

---

### Argument 36 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- There is really no experience which can take the place of disinterested affection.
- The first task of a mother is to give her child the experience of a trustworthy other person: later she must widen and enlarge this feeling of trust until it includes the rest of the child's environment.
- If she has failed in the first task to gain the child's interest, affection and cooperation it will be very difficult for the child to develop social interest and comradely feeling towards his fellows.

**→ Conclusion:** Everybody has the capacity to be interested in others; but this capacity must be trained and exercised or its development will be frustrated.

*Source: Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority | Importance: 7/10*

---

### Argument 37 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The fundamental estimate of the individual and his situation is contained in it; it is his first totalling-up of appearances, his first more or less complete symbol of himself and the demands made of him.
- Secondly, it is his subjective starting point, the beginning of the autobiography he has made up for himself.
- We can often find in it, therefore, the contrast between a position of weakness and inadequacy in which he felt himself and the goal of strength and security which he regards as his ideal.

**→ Conclusion:** For two reasons the earliest memory of all has a very notable place.

## Early Memories

### Argument 38 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- If once the meaning given to life is found and understood, we have the key to the whole personality
- It is sometimes stated that human character is unchangeable, but this position can be held only by those who have never found the right key to the situation
- As we have already seen, however, no argument or treatment can be successful if it falls short of discovering the original error
- the only possibility of improvement lies in the training for a more cooperative and courageous approach to life

**→ Conclusion:** the only possibility of improvement lies in the training for a more cooperative and courageous approach to life

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- It is sometimes stated that human character is unchangeable

### Argument 39 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Only the individual who understands that life means contribution will be able to meet his difficulties with courage and with a good chance of success
- If teachers and parents and psychologists understand the mistakes that can be made in giving a meaning to life, and if they do not make the same mistakes themselves
- we can be confident that children who have been lacking in social interest will come to have a better feeling for their own capacities and for the opportunities of life

**→ Conclusion:** Only the individual who understands that life means contribution will be able to meet his difficulties with courage and with a good chance of success

*Source: Early Memories | Importance: 9/10*

### Argument 40 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- cooperation is also the only safeguard we have against the development of neurotic tendencies
- It is therefore of supreme importance that children should be trained and encouraged in cooperation
- should be allowed to find their own way amongst children of their own age, in common tasks and common games
- Any block in cooperation will have the most serious results

**→ Conclusion:** cooperation is also the only safeguard we have against the development of neurotic tendencies

*Source: Early Memories | Importance: 8/10*

### Argument 41 (analogical)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- We do not expect a child who has never been taught geography to answer an examination paper on the subject with success
- we cannot expect a child who has never been trained in cooperation to answer correctly when tasks which demand training in cooperation are set before him
- But every problem of life demands an ability to cooperate for its solution
- every task must be mastered within the framework of our human society and in a way which furthers our human welfare

**→ Conclusion:** we cannot expect a child who has never been trained in cooperation to answer correctly when tasks which demand training in cooperation are set before him

### Argument 42 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- this boy had early gained the impression that life in the outside world was full of dangers
- he had concluded that he was only safe if others were apprehensive on his behalf
- Only in this way could he reassure himself that they were there to protect him if he needed it

**→ Conclusion:** this boy had early gained the impression that life in the outside world was full of dangers and he had concluded that he was only safe if others were apprehensive on his behalf

*Source: Early Memories | Importance: 7/10*

### Argument 43 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- It is always best when a new child is born to gain the cooperation of the older children in taking care of it; to interest them in the newcomer and allow them to share the responsibility for its welfare
- If their cooperation is gained they will not be tempted to feel the attention given to the baby as a diminution of their own importance

**→ Conclusion:** If their cooperation is gained they will not be tempted to feel the attention given to the baby as a diminution of their own importance

*Source: Early Memories | Importance: 7/10*

### Argument 44 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The spoiled child, for example, who has learned to be interested only in himself, will carry this lack of interest in others to school with him
- His lessons will interest him only so far as he thinks he can gain his teacher's favor
- he will listen only to what he conceives to be advantageous to himself
- As he comes near to adult age, his failure in social feeling will become more and more evidently calamitous
- When his error first occurred, he ceased training himself for responsibility and independence; and by now he is painfully ill-equipped for any of life's tests

**→ Conclusion:** As he comes near to adult age, his failure in social feeling will become more and more evidently calamitous

### Argument 45 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The first memory of a woman of thirty-five was 'as follows: "When I was three years old I went down into the cellar. While I was on the stairs in the dark, a boy cousin, a little older than myself, opened the door and came down after me. I was very frightened of him."'
- It seemed probable from this memory that she had not been accustomed to playing with other children
- she was especially ill at ease with the other sex
- A guess that she was an only child proved correct; and she was still, at the age of thirty-five, unmarried

**→ Conclusion:** It seemed probable from this memory that she had not been accustomed to playing with other children and that she was especially ill at ease with the other sex

### Argument 46 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- One girl, when asked for her first memory, replied, 'I was playing with my elder sister and two girl friends.'
- Here we can certainly see a child training to be sociable
- but we obtain a new insight into her striving when she mentions as her greatest fear, 'I am afraid of being left alone.'
- We shall look, therefore, for signs of a lack of independence

**→ Conclusion:** We shall look, therefore, for signs of a lack of independence

### Argument 47 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- A higher development of social feeling is shown in the following: 'I remember my mother letting me wheel my baby sister in the perambulator.'
- In this instance, however, we might look also for signs of being at ease only with weaker people; and perhaps of dependence upon the mother

**→ Conclusion:** A higher development of social feeling is shown in the following memory, though there might be signs of being at ease only with weaker people and dependence upon the mother

## Case Studies and Practical Applications

### Argument 48 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- In every human being, moreover, we can discover behind all partial movements towards partial goals one single inclusive movement.
- All our strivings are directed towards a position in which a feeling of security has been achieved, a feeling that all the difficulties of life have been overcome and that we have emerged finally, in relation to the whole situation around us, safe and victorious.

**→ Conclusion:** With this purpose in view, all movements and expressions must be coordinated and brought into a unity: the mind is compelled to develop as if to achieve a final ideal goal.

### Argument 49 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- All moving beings, however, can foresee and reckon up the direction in which to move; and this fact makes it necessary to postulate that they have minds or souls.
- This foreseeing the direction of movement is the central principle of the mind.
- As soon as we have recognized it we are in a position to understand how the mind governs the body — it sets the goal for movements.
- Merely to initiate a random movement from moment to moment would never be enough: there must be a goal for the strivings.

**→ Conclusion:** Since it is the mind's function to decide a point towards which movement is to be made, it occupies the governing position in life.

### Argument 50 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The province of psychology is to explore the meaning involved in all the expressions of an individual, to find the key to his goal, and to compare it with the goals of others.
- In striving for the final goal of security, the mind is always faced with the necessity of making the goal concrete; of calculating 'security lies in this particular point; it is reached by going in this particular direction.'
- Here, of course, the chance of a mistake occurs; but without a quite definite goal and direction-setting there could be no movement at all.

**→ Conclusion:** All psychological mistakes are thus mistakes in choosing the direction of movement.

*Source: Case Studies and Practical Applications | Importance: 9/10*

### Argument 51 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- What is new in the outlook of Individual Psychology is our observation that the feelings are never in contradiction to the style of life.
- Where there is a goal, the feelings always adapt themselves to its attainment.
- We are no longer, therefore, in the realm of physiology or biology; the rise of feelings cannot be explained by chemical theory and cannot be predicted by chemical examination.

**→ Conclusion:** In Individual Psychology we must presuppose the physiological processes, but we are more interested in the psychological goal.

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- Such explanations are beside the mark.
- With this approach anxiety cannot be taken as rising from the suppression of sexuality, or as being left behind as the result of disastrous birth-experiences.

### Argument 52 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Men are more engaged in movement than any other beings.
- They do not only move in more ways — as we can see in the complicated movements of their hands — but they are also more capable, by means of their movements, of moving the environment around them.

**→ Conclusion:** We should expect, therefore, that the ability to foresee would be most highly developed in the human mind, and that men would give the clearest evidence of a purposive striving to improve their whole position with respect to their whole situation.

### Argument 53 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Body and mind are cooperating as indivisible parts of one whole.
- The mind is like a motor, dragging with it all the potentialities which it can discover in the body, helping to bring the body into a position of safety and superiority to all difficulties.

**→ Conclusion:** In every movement of the body, in every expression and symptom, we can see the impress of the mind's purpose.

*Source: Case Studies and Practical Applications | Importance: 8/10*

### Argument 54 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- We know that a child who is accustomed to be accompanied, helped and supported by its mother may find anxiety — whatever its source — a very efficient weapon for controlling its mother.
- We are not satisfied with a physical description of anger; our experience has shown us that anger is a device to dominate a person or a situation.

**→ Conclusion:** We can take it for granted that every bodily and mental expression must be based on inherited material; but our attention is directed to the use which is made of this material in striving to achieve a definite goal.

*Source: Case Studies and Practical Applications | Importance: 8/10*

### Argument 55 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- It is, as we have already seen, in the first four or five years of life that the individual is establishing the unity of his mind and constructing the relations between mind and body.
- He is taking his hereditary material and the impressions he receives from the environment and is adapting them to his pursuit of superiority.
- By the end of the fifth year his personality has crystallized.

**→ Conclusion:** The meaning he gives to life, the goal he pursues, his style of approach, and his emotional disposition are all fixed.

### Argument 56 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The mind can move the body only in accordance with the possibilities which the body possesses and those which it can be trained to develop.
- If, for example, the mind proposes to move the body to the moon, it will fail unless it discovers a technique suited to the body's limitations.

**→ Conclusion:** At the same time, the body influences the mind; it is the body which must be moved.

### Argument 57 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The goal of security is common to all human beings; but some of them mistake the direction in which security lies and their concrete movements lead them astray.
- If we see an expression or symptom and fail to recognize the meaning behind it, the best way to understand it is, first of all, to reduce it in outline to a bare movement.
- Let us take, for example, the expression of stealing. To steal is to remove property from another person to oneself.
- The goal is to enrich oneself, and to feel more secure by possessing more.
- The point at which the movement sets out is therefore a feeling of being poor and deprived.

**→ Conclusion:** Finally we can see whether he is taking the right way to change these circumstances and overcome his feeling of being deprived; whether the movement is in the right direction, or whether he has mistaken the method of securing what he desires.

### Argument 58 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- A patient of mine, a second child, suffered very profoundly from inescapable feelings of guilt.
- He felt inferior to his elder brother in school work and social attractiveness; and he tried to achieve superiority by a sideline of his own.
- By means of his sensitive conscience he was much more burdened than his brother; and thus he had an excuse prepared for all failures to equal him.
- His escape from examinations and occupational work gives a sign of cowardice and a heightened feeling of inadequacy; and his whole neurosis was a purposive exclusion of every activity in which he feared a defeat.

**→ Conclusion:** His feelings of guilt were means to make him appear more honest than others and in this way he was struggling to achieve superiority. His struggles, however, were directed towards the useless side of life.

## Educational and Therapeutic Implications

### Argument 59 (conditional)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Only a child who desires to contribute to the whole, whose interest is not centered in himself, can train successfully to compensate for defects.
- If children desire only to rid themselves of difficulties, they will continue backward.
- They can keep up their courage only if they have a purpose in view for their efforts and if the achievement of this purpose is more important to them than the obstacles which stand in the way.
- If a child is to draw together his powers and overcome his difficulties, there must be a goal for his movements outside of himself; a goal based on interest in reality, interest in others, and interest in cooperation.

**→ Conclusion:** If they are striving towards an object external to themselves, they will quite naturally train and equip themselves to achieve it.

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- If children desire only to rid themselves of difficulties, they will continue backward

### Argument 60 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- A body which is ill-suited to the environment and has difficulty in fulfilling the demands of the environment will usually be felt by the mind as a burden.
- For this reason children who have suffered from imperfect organs meet with greater hindrances than usual for their mental development.
- It is harder for their minds to influence, move and govern their bodies towards a position of superiority.
- A greater effort of mind is needed, and mental concentration must be higher than with others if they are to secure the same object.

**→ Conclusion:** So the mind becomes overburdened and they become self-centered and egoistic.

*Source: Educational and Therapeutic Implications | Importance: 9/10*

### Argument 61 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Imperfect organs offer many handicaps but these handicaps are by no means an inescapable fate.
- If the mind is active on its own part and trains hard to overcome the difficulties, the individual may very well succeed in being as successful as those who were originally less burdened.
- Indeed, children with imperfect organs very often accomplish, in spite of their obstacles, more than children who start with more normal instruments.
- The handicap was a stimulus to go further ahead.

**→ Conclusion:** An imperfect organ can turn out to be the source of great advantages; but only if the mind has found the right technique for overcoming difficulties.

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- Imperfect organs offer many handicaps

### Argument 62 (deductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- If we notice the way he looks and listens and what it is that attracts his attention, we have learned much about him.
- This is the reason why postures have such an importance; they show us the training of the organs and the use which is being made of them to select impressions.
- Postures are always conditioned by meanings.

**→ Conclusion:** Psychology is the understanding of an individual's attitude towards the impressions of his body.

*Source: Educational and Therapeutic Implications | Importance: 8/10*

### Argument 63 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- When a child is always occupied with the imperfection of its organs and the difficulties of movement, it has no attention to spare for what is outside itself.
- It finds neither the time nor the freedom to interest itself in others.

**→ Conclusion:** In consequence grows up with a lesser degree of social feeling and ability to cooperate.

*Source: Educational and Therapeutic Implications | Importance: 8/10*

### Argument 64 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The organ inferiority is real; it can be shown in the kidney or the bladder or in the existence of a spina bifida; and often a corresponding imperfection of the lumbar segment can be suspected from a nevus or birth mole on the skin in that area.
- The organ inferiority, however, by no means accounts sufficiently for the enuresis.
- The child is not under the compulsion of his organs; and he uses them in his own way.
- Some children, for example, will wet the bed at night and never wet themselves during the day.
- Sometimes the habit will disappear suddenly, upon a change in the environment or in the attitude of the parents.

**→ Conclusion:** Enuresis can be overcome, except among feeble-minded children, if the child ceases to use the imperfection of his organs for a mistaken purpose.

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- The organ inferiority is real

*Source: Educational and Therapeutic Implications | Importance: 8/10*

### Argument 65 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- The purpose which enuresis serves is generally to attract notice, to subordinate others, to occupy their attention in the nighttime as well as the day.
- Sometimes it is to antagonize them; the habit is a declaration of enmity.
- Children who express themselves in this way are always suffering from a tension.
- Generally they belong to the class of spoiled children who have lost their position of being the unique center of attention.
- Another child has been born, perhaps, and they find it more difficult to secure the undivided attention of their mothers.

**→ Conclusion:** Enuresis thus represents a movement to come in closer contact with the mother, even by unpleasant means.

### Argument 66 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- A boy, for example, may suffer unusual stress through the imperfection of his eyes.
- He is more occupied in trying to see; he gives more attention to the visible world; he is more interested in distinguishing colors and forms.
- In the end, he comes to have a much greater experience of the visible world than children who never needed to struggle or to pay attention to small distinctions.
- Among painters and poets a great proportion are known to have suffered from imperfections of sight.

**→ Conclusion:** These imperfections have been governed by well-trained minds; and finally their possessors could use their eyes to more purpose than others who were more nearly normal.

*Source: Educational and Therapeutic Implications | Importance: 7/10*

### Argument 67 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Often in families which suffer from kidney troubles or bladder troubles everything to do with urinating is overstressed.
- Mothers will then mistakenly try very hard to stop the enuresis.
- If the child notices how much value is placed on this point, he will very probably resist.
- It will give him a very good opportunity to assert his opposition to this kind of education.

**→ Conclusion:** If a child resists the treatment which his parents give him, he will always find his way to attack them at their point of greatest weakness.

*Source: Educational and Therapeutic Implications | Importance: 7/10*

### Argument 68 (analogical)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- A very well-known sociologist in Germany has discovered that a surprising proportion of criminals spring from families which are occupied in the suppression of crime; from the families of judges, policemen, or prison warders.
- Often the children of teachers are obstinately backward.
- In my own experience I have often found this true; and I have found also a surprising number of neurotic children among the children of doctors and of delinquent children among the children of ministers of religion.

**→ Conclusion:** In a similar way, the children whose parents over-stress urination have a very clear way open for them to show that they have wills of their own.

## Conclusion and Reflections

### Argument 69 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- In all probability the mind does not only affect the choice of a particular bodily Symptom; it is governing and influencing the whole building-up of the body.
- We have no direct proof of this hypothesis; and it is difficult to see how a proof could ever be established.
- The evidence, however, seems clear enough.
- If a boy is timid, his timidity is reflected in his whole development.
- He will not care for physical achievements; or, rather, he will not think of them as possible for himself.
- In consequence, it will not occur to him to train his muscles in an efficient way, and he will exclude all the impressions from outside that would ordinarily be a stimulus to muscular development.
- Other children, who allow themselves to be influenced and interested in the training of their muscles, will go farther ahead in physical fitness; he, because his interest is blocked, will remain behind.

**→ Conclusion:** From such consideration we can fairly conclude that the whole form and development of the body is affected by the mind and reflects the errors or deficiencies of the mind.

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- We have no direct proof of this hypothesis; and it is difficult to see how a proof could ever be established.

### Argument 70 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- Some children walk in their sleep, have nightmares, fall out of bed, or become thirsty and call for water.
- The psychological background for these expressions is similar.
- The choice of symptom depends in part on the organic situation and in part on the attitude of the environment.
- Such cases show very well the influence which the mind exerts over the body.

**→ Conclusion:** Such cases show very well the influence which the mind exerts over the body.

### Argument 71 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- To a certain degree every emotion finds some bodily expression.
- The individual will show his emotion in some visible form; perhaps in his posture and attitude, perhaps in his face, perhaps in the trembling of his legs and knees.
- Similar changes could be found in the organs themselves.
- If he flushes or turns pale, for example, the circulation of the blood is affected.
- In anger, anxiety, sorrow or any other emotion, the body always speaks; and each individual's body speaks in a language of its own.

**→ Conclusion:** The body always speaks; and each individual's body speaks in a language of its own.

### Argument 72 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- A mental tension affects both the voluntary system and the vegetative nerve system.
- Where there is tension, there is action in the voluntary system.
- The individual drums on the table, plucks at his lip or tears up pieces of paper.
- If he is tense, he has to move in some way.
- Chewing a pencil or a cigar gives him an outlet for his tension.
- These movements show us that he feels himself too much confronted by some situation.
- By means of the vegetative system, the tension is communicated to the whole body; and so, with every emotion, the whole body is itself in a tension.

**→ Conclusion:** With every emotion, the whole body is itself in a tension.

*Source: Conclusion and Reflections | Importance: 8/10*

### Argument 73 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- We can often observe bodily expressions which are plainly the end results of mental failings, where the right way to compensate for a difficulty has not been discovered.
- We may be sure, for example, that the endocrine glands themselves can be influenced in the first four or five years of life.
- Imperfect glands never have a compulsive influence on conduct; on the other hand, they are being continuously affected by the whole environment, by the direction in which the child seeks to receive impressions, and by the creative activity of its mind in this interesting situation.

**→ Conclusion:** We may be sure, for example, that the endocrine glands themselves can be influenced in the first four or five years of life.

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- Imperfect glands never have a compulsive influence on conduct.

*Source: Conclusion and Reflections | Importance: 7/10*

### Argument 74 (causal)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- In an outburst of temper, for example, the individual has wished to overcome his imperfections as quickly as possible.
- The best way has seemed to be to hit, accuse or attack another individual.
- The anger, in its turn, influences the organs: mobilizes them for action or lays an additional stress on them.
- Some people when they are angry have stomach trouble at the same time, or grow red in the face.
- Their circulation is altered to such a degree that a headache ensues.
- We shall generally find unadmitted rage or humiliation behind attacks of migraine, or habitual headaches; and with some people anger results in trigeminal neuralgia or fits of an epileptic nature.

**→ Conclusion:** The anger, in its turn, influences the organs: mobilizes them for action or lays an additional stress on them.

### Argument 75 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- When one man is in a situation in which he is afraid, he trembles; the hair of another will start on end; a third will have palpitations of the heart.
- Still others will sweat or choke, speak in a hoarse voice, or shrink physically and cower away.
- Sometimes the tonus of the body is affected, the appetite lost, or vomiting induced.
- With some it is the bladder which is mainly irritated by such emotions, with others the sexual organs.
- Many children feel stimulated in the sexual organs when taking examinations; and it is well known that criminals will frequently go to a house of prostitution, or to their sweethearts, after they have committed a crime.

**→ Conclusion:** All of these responses belong to different types of individuals.

### Argument 76 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- All of these responses belong to different types of individuals.
- They could probably be discovered to be to some extent hereditary, and physical expressions of this kind will often give us hints of the weaknesses and peculiarities of the family tree.
- Other members of the family may make a very similar bodily response.

**→ Conclusion:** Physical expressions of this kind will often give us hints of the weaknesses and peculiarities of the family tree.

### Argument 77 (inductive)
**Author:** adler

**Premises:**
- In the realm of science we find psychologists who claim that sex and anxiety go together and psychologists who claim that they have not the remotest connection.
- Their point of view depends on their personal experience; with some there is a connection, with others not.

**→ Conclusion:** Their point of view depends on their personal experience; with some there is a connection, with others not.

**Counterarguments addressed:**
- Psychologists who claim that sex and anxiety have not the remotest connection.
