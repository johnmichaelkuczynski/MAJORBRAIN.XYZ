ADLER | The goal of life is the maintenance of life | Introduction: Adler and Our Neurotic World
ADLER | Viewed objectively and dispassionately we see that every human organism strives for a measure of security and totality which makes continued existence tolerable. | Introduction: Adler and Our Neurotic World
ADLER | To understand a human being you must understand his relative situation in the human group in which he moves. | Introduction: Adler and Our Neurotic World
ADLER | The pattern of the human race has been a pattern beginning in individual weakness, moving toward a goal of comparative security in social solidarity. | Introduction: Adler and Our Neurotic World
ADLER | In affirming the multiplex bonds that bind human being to human being, the normal mature individual gains a measure of peace, security, and a sense of totality and validity which make life worth living. | Introduction: Adler and Our Neurotic World
ADLER | Unfortunately for us this normal pattern of development does not always occur. | Introduction: Adler and Our Neurotic World
ADLER | It is in this situation that the feeling of inferiority, a cornerstone of Individual Psychology, is created. | Introduction: Adler and Our Neurotic World
ADLER | The inferiority feeling to which every human being is heir because of his physical and biological constellation in the cosmos need not therefore be an individual liability. | Introduction: Adler and Our Neurotic World
ADLER | Our neurotics far outnumber our geniuses. How can we account for the failure of useful compensation? | Introduction: Adler and Our Neurotic World
ADLER | Patterns of life are usually fixed by the time a child is five or six years old. | Introduction: Adler and Our Neurotic World
ADLER | Problems of society, of work, and of sex. | Introduction: Adler and Our Neurotic World
ADLER | Sexual behavior is never a cause of neurosis or insanity�it is one of its manifestations. | Introduction: Adler and Our Neurotic World
ADLER | The goal of impotence is omnipotence. | Introduction: Adler and Our Neurotic World
ADLER | A few examples of neuroses in childhood will help us understand their dynamics. | Introduction: Adler and Our Neurotic World
ADLER | The therapy of Individual Psychology is based on the application of its philosophic premises. | Introduction: Adler and Our Neurotic World
ADLER | Individual Psychology, therefore, has grown beyond its original scope as a system of psychotherapy, and has taken its place as a fundamental cornerstone of sociology and pedagogy. | Introduction: Adler and Our Neurotic World
ADLER | This group of symptoms, which are present in a true epilepsy, distinguishes it from other fainting attacks of an hysterical nature, in which the person feels himself injured, hopeless, and powerless, and expresses his attitude in a gesture of his entire body. | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | One of the important differential points between epilepsy and hysteria is that the epileptic does not know that he has fainted—he realizes it only after the attack is over. | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | I believe that this susceptibility consists in a pathologic variation of the blood-vessels of the brain. | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | An epileptic attack much resembles the picture of a man in a towering rage. | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | Usually epileptics are very cruel, and in their dreams they often experience brutality and fighting. | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | I have found that epilepsy disappeared when the patient became socially well adjusted, even in cases where many other physicians had corroborated the diagnosis. | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | I do not mean by this that I am able to cure epilepsy, but I do say that the symptoms of epilepsy can sometimes be alleviated and the patient made much more comfortable if we can bring about a greater degree of social adjustment. | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | Here is evidence that the girl not only refuses to be alone, but that her first attack served to accentuate her dependence. | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | Such independence would be of great advantage to her; it is, in fact, her only hope of a cure. | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | She wanted to be a teacher, but gave up her ambition because of the extra effort that was required. | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | Whenever the menstrual period arrives the patient becomes more tense, and it is this tension which is an important determinant of the beginning of the spells. | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | Her problem is how to reach this goal. Otherwise her entire scheme of life is shattered and she is powerless. | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | Either her fianc� will be shocked by her illness and decide not to marry her, or she will insist on the formula, 'Wait until I am well.' | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | Going with one boy for eight years is too long. And since her attacks are more frequent now, I am sure that one of two things will happen. | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | Her goal in life is to escape the problem of love and she realizes her goal, not only by dividing her love interests, but by exaggerating her fainting spells to demonstrate that she is not responsible. | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | The case history gives two more important points. 'At the time of the second attack a grandchild was born and Flora's mother kept her at the house most of the time. Also at this time she met the first young man with whom she fell in love.' | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | It is interesting to see how she formulates her own style of life in the statement, 'I would marry, if I did not have these attacks.' | Principles of Individual Psychology
ADLER | In March, 1926, he was examined by the inspector of the ungraded classes. He was then eight years old and he attained a mental age of four years, six months. | Patterns of Life and Childhood Development
ADLER | His intelligence quotient according to the Stanford-Binet Test, was 52, the basal year was 3, the upper limits 7. | Patterns of Life and Childhood Development
ADLER | His reaction time is quick, and his attention good. He habitually repeated the last word he had spoken, but the present teacher does not find that he does this. | Patterns of Life and Childhood Development
ADLER | The boy is seriously retarded in mental development and fails to distinguish colors and forms. (He had no glasses at this time.) | Patterns of Life and Childhood Development
ADLER | His memory for digits is equal to a four-year child, while his memory for thoughts is equal to a three-year child. | Patterns of Life and Childhood Development
ADLER | At first he claims that he has no childhood remembrances, but states, 'A little girl used to let me ride on her bicycle.' This happened recently, but he speaks of it as if it had happened a long time ago. | Patterns of Life and Childhood Development
ADLER | Another ambition is to be big enough to play around in the street; he does not want to work to earn money. Given three wishes, he chooses: to be big, to be strong, to learn his lessons. | Patterns of Life and Childhood Development
ADLER | Given his choice of staying in the house to read a book or going on the street, he chooses the second. | Patterns of Life and Childhood Development
ADLER | The teacher believes this is a case of a discouraged youngest child handicapped by the clumsiness of his large size and his left-handedness. | Patterns of Life and Childhood Development
ADLER | We believe that he is an intelligent boy, and that his difficulties are largely due to the fact that he does not see any necessity for acting independently so long as you solve his problems for him. | Patterns of Life and Childhood Development
ADLER | We also believe that the child is left-handed and that this left-handedness is the cause of much of his trouble, especially in reading and spelling. | Patterns of Life and Childhood Development
ADLER | The father must be taught to conciliate the child, rather than to punish him with a razor strap. | Patterns of Life and Childhood Development
ADLER | It is entirely useless to wait until a boy has committed a hold-up, before we consider him a criminal. | Patterns of Life and Childhood Development
ADLER | This evening we are to consider the case of John, who is almost nine years old. This is his present problem: 'Difficulties with other children. He loves to fight at all times.' | Patterns of Life and Childhood Development
ADLER | The father takes entire charge of the training and discipline of the boy. | Patterns of Life and Childhood Development
ADLER | The little girl is very smart, obedient, and lovable. The parents often remind John how careful and obedient his little sister is, and her conduct is given as a pattern to follow. | Patterns of Life and Childhood Development
ADLER | If this child's goal is in his unconscious, how can he be rational about it? | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | We proceed by holding up a mirror to his soul; we enable him to see his attitude and compare it with other pictures that we make. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | And once he has completely understood the reasons for his behavior, he will be a different boy. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | If a child is first overindulged and petted, and then suddenly loses his accustomed support, he feels as though he had lost a paradise. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | The boy will never change until we convince him that he can only be loved and appreciated by being useful. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | I am sure that he can be reconciled to his place in the family, as well as to his place in the school. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | If a boy is good in reading and arithmetic, and can fight, I am certain that he can also do well in other subjects and conduct himself perfectly. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | It is splendid to be a leader in good work, but sometimes a boy believes it is better to be a leader in bad things. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | To disturb people in order to be the center of attention is very cowardly. It is much braver to help other people. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | Consciousness and unconsciousness are never contradictions. They are two streams that flow in the same direction. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | Grant that he wants to remain a baby, and you can find no more effective technique than the one he has chosen. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | It would be a great mistake to reproach him or punish him for his tricks. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | I think they are very artistic. If he is going to act like a baby, he must defend himself like one. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | He cannot change his goal, because he has no insight into his situation. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | I hardly believe it will be very difficult to make George understand that to grow up means to have more power, and that it is better to strive for progress than to look for the paradise of the past. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | I am your friend. I see you are a big boy and you ought to be able to walk alone without your mother. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | It was my chief desire to point out to his parents that John is not guilty, because they have always considered him so. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | We have found that your son believes his sister has a distinct advantage, and he is hopeless because he feels that he is out of the competition. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | Perhaps you believe your mother does not love you enough and that your sister does not care for you either. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | If you would help your mother a little more, your mother and sister would certainly like you better. | Neuroses and Their Origins
ADLER | Her condition is particularly unfavorable with her mother. Rarely is the child eager for food and almost always she dawdles over her meals. | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | The worst meal is breakfast, at which Betty can hardly be forced to eat anything. | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | For a long time she resorted to vomiting and had a number of food fads. If she was forced to eat she would vomit. | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | There is a secondary problem, in that in the last two years she has evinced a growing unsocial attitude and increasing belligerency toward others, including her mother. She refuses to greet people. | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | Betty does not speak freely or civilly to people she meets and often uses abusive language. | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | She seems to think a great deal and often desires to be quiet for long periods of time, which she spends in brooding; but often she emerges from these moods with very intelligent questions. | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | The outdoors and nature are very dear to her. She asks constantly to live in the country, and when scenery is especially appealing she is moved to say with elation, 'Isn't the world beautiful?' | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | The other day, however, when she seemed to be impressed with the freshness and beauty of the sunny morning she said pointedly, 'I like being cross.' | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | The parents say the eating problem has existed since she was born, but that her other difficulties are new developments. | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | This immediate family consists of mother, father, and the one child. The relationship between the parents is a loving one, and the home may be said to be one of real marital happiness, although there is a considerable nervous tension due to economic stress and a long siege of illness in the mother's own family, with which she has been in intimate contact. | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | The grandmother's attitude toward the mother has continued to be a critical one, even in the child's presence, and the mother believes that the grandmother's influence has precipitated the child's present critical and unfriendly attitude toward her. | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | The child was in perfect health at birth, was breast-fed for seven months, and then weaned. Immediately thereafter, she was given impure milk, which caused a severe intestinal disorder that required a long time to heal. | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | When Betty's hands were bound she resorted to vomiting. | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | When less than two years old Betty replied when threatened with the loss of her toys: 'I don't care, I don't need them. I can look out of the window and think.' | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | The social position of the family is in the upper middle class. The parents' friends are chiefly professional people. | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | Until recently she had a very marked attraction for older boys, and used her charm with relish. | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | The only thing to do with a naked woman is to electrocute her. | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | If you don't do such and such, I'll send the influenza to get you tonight, I'll send it through the open window and you'll die. | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | I have done that time and time again, but she is not interested. She is very abstract about the matter, and so emotionally involved and so resentful that she will not allow her mental faculties to operate. | Therapy and Treatment in Individual Psychology
ADLER | The less you demand of such a child, the less trouble you will have. | Case Studies: Understanding Human Behavior
ADLER | His stories were evidently suggested by facts which he deliberately injected into his own life, but at the time they were told no one knew that they were derived from veritable occurrences. | Case Studies: Understanding Human Behavior
ADLER | Our patient has no resistance to his sister because he is with her too much. I believe if he spent more time with his father he would be more critical of her. | Case Studies: Understanding Human Behavior
ADLER | Saul plays the role of protector, which is a good way to reconcile an older brother to a sister, because it gives him an opportunity to feel grown up. | Case Studies: Understanding Human Behavior
ADLER | Many people believe that craftiness and trickery are advantageous, but we can hardly agree with this from the psychological point of view. | Case Studies: Understanding Human Behavior
ADLER | Tricks, slyness, and cunning should be recognized as the devices of a coward. | Case Studies: Understanding Human Behavior
ADLER | I think from now on, you will be able to make very good progress in school. | Case Studies: Understanding Human Behavior
ADLER | You will find that she will not be as strict as she used to be, especially if you get good school reports. | Case Studies: Understanding Human Behavior
ADLER | He is a good boy but he finds things very difficult in school. Probably the origin of his difficulties is the fact that he was an only child for three and one-half years and found life easier than he does today. | Case Studies: Understanding Human Behavior
ADLER | She is indifferent to the wishes of her family, in that she does not want to go to school. | Case Studies: Understanding Human Behavior
ADLER | Rachel suffered the typical dethronement of the child used to a central position in her family, on the arrival of a little sister. | Case Studies: Understanding Human Behavior
ADLER | Rachel dominated the entire family; when she is crossed, she screams. | Case Studies: Understanding Human Behavior
ADLER | Rachel came to the elementary school to answer the questions for this case history, and brought along a girl whom she seems to have adopted as a friend. | Case Studies: Understanding Human Behavior
ADLER | This interesting evidence confirms my feeling that she belongs to a domineering type, and is not at all averse to fighting others. | Case Studies: Understanding Human Behavior
ADLER | Many of my students have questioned the statement that I have often made, that the pattern of an individual's life is fixed by the time he is five years old. | Conclusion and Reflections
ADLER | Milton's crying is just another expression of his will to power. | Conclusion and Reflections
ADLER | You must not believe that Milton really loves his mother. | Conclusion and Reflections
ADLER | He is interested in her only as a parasite is interested in its host. | Conclusion and Reflections
ADLER | Many people believe that tears are a sign of weakness, but in this case they are surely a sign of power. | Conclusion and Reflections
ADLER | Milton does not look, nor listen, nor speak to anyone but his mother, and in his complete attachment to her is the beginning of his neurosis. | Conclusion and Reflections
ADLER | If he meets very great problems which demand independence and strength, with which he is not equipped, he may later commit suicide. | Conclusion and Reflections
ADLER | On the other hand, it is easy to pique the curiosity of this child by not paying attention to him. | Conclusion and Reflections
ADLER | You can imagine that an ivy plant that has long been attached to its trellis, fears to be removed from that trellis. | Conclusion and Reflections
ADLER | I have often noticed that robbers and other criminals have written poems in prison in which they shift the guilt for their crime to their mothers, or blame alcohol, morphine, or disappointment in love, for their shortcomings. | Conclusion and Reflections
ADLER | If enough is known about the boy to instruct his mother how to act toward him, the child can be influenced without his open cooperation. | Conclusion and Reflections
ADLER | With this difference, when the host does not suit the human parasite, the parasite punishes the host. | Conclusion and Reflections
