adler | Human beings live in the realm of meanings. We do not experience pure circumstances; we always experience circumstances in their significance for men. | Preface and Introduction
adler | We experience reality always through the meaning we give it; not in itself, but as something interpreted. | Preface and Introduction
adler | If a man should try to escape meanings and devote himself only to circumstances he would be very unfortunate: he would isolate himself from others. | Preface and Introduction
adler | There are as many meanings given to life as there are human beings, and, as we have suggested, perhaps each meaning involves more or less of a mistake. | Preface and Introduction
adler | No one possesses the absolute meaning of life, and we may say that any meaning which is at all serviceable cannot be called absolutely wrong. | Preface and Introduction
adler | We can discover what it is that the better meanings share in common, what it is that the worse meanings lack. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Every human being has three main ties; and it is of these ties that he must take account. They make up reality for him. | Preface and Introduction
adler | The first of these ties is that we are living on the crust of this poor planet, earth, and nowhere else. | Preface and Introduction
adler | In body and mind alike we must develop so that we can continue our personal lives on earth and help to insure the future continuance of mankind. | Preface and Introduction
adler | We are not the only members of the human race. There are others around us, and we are living in association with them. | Preface and Introduction
adler | The weakness and the limits of the individual human being make it impossible for him to ensure his own aims in isolation. | Preface and Introduction
adler | If he lived alone and tried to meet his problems by himself he would perish. He would not be able to continue his own life. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Human beings are living in two sexes. The preservation of individual and of common life must take account of this fact. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Individual Psychology has found no problems in life which cannot be grouped under these three main problems—occupational, social and sexual. | Preface and Introduction
adler | It is in his response to these three problems that every individual human being unfailingly reveals his own deep sense of the meaning of life. | Preface and Introduction
adler | All failures — neurotics, psychotics, criminals, drunkards, problem children, suicides, perverts and prostitutes — are failures because they are lacking in fellow-feeling and social interest. | Preface and Introduction
adler | They approach the problems of occupation, friendship and sex without the confidence that they can be solved by cooperation. | Preface and Introduction
adler | The meaning they give to life is a private meaning: no one else is benefited by the achievement of their aims and their interest stops short at their own persons. | Preface and Introduction
adler | A private meaning is in fact no meaning at all. Meaning is only possible in communication: a word which meant something to one person only would really be meaningless. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Every human being strives for significance; but people always make mistakes if they do not see that their whole significance must consist in their contribution to the lives of others. | Preface and Introduction
adler | The mark of all true 'meanings of life' is that they are common meanings — they are meanings in which others can share, and meanings which others can accept as valid. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Even genius is to be defined as no more than supreme usefulness: it is only when a man's life is recognized by others as having significance for them that we call him a genius. | Preface and Introduction
adler | The man who meets the problems of human life successfully acts as if he recognized, fully and spontaneously, that the meaning of life is interest in others and cooperation. | Preface and Introduction
adler | Everything he does seems to be guided by the interest of his fellow beings; and where he meets difficulties he tries to surmount them only by means consonant with human welfare. | Preface and Introduction
adler | If a human being, in the meaning he gives to life, wishes to make a contribution, and if his emotions are all directed to this goal, he will naturally be bound to bring himself into the best shape for contribution. | Preface and Introduction
adler | If we are interested in our partner, if we are working to ease and enrich our partner's life, of course we shall make the best of ourselves that we can. | Preface and Introduction
adler | All that survives of them is the contributions they have made to human life. We see cultivated ground; we see roadways and buildings; we see the communicated results of their experience of life. | Preface and Introduction
adler | What has happened to those who never cooperated, who gave life a different meaning, who asked only, 'What can I get out of life?' They have left no trace behind them. | Preface and Introduction
adler | The last judgment for people who give any other meaning to life than cooperation is always, 'You are useless. Nobody wants you. Go!' | The Meaning of Life
adler | There have always been men who understood this fact; who knew that the meaning of life is to be interested in the whole of mankind and who tried to develop social interest and love. | The Meaning of Life
adler | In all religions we find this concern for the salvation of man. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Individual Psychology arrives at the same conclusion in a scientific way and proposes a scientific technique. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Since the meaning given to life works out as if it were the guardian angel or pursuing demon of our careers, it is very dearly of the highest importance that we should understand how these meanings come to be formed. | The Meaning of Life
adler | By the end of the fifth year of life a child has reached a unified and crystallized pattern of behavior, its own style of approach to problems and tasks. | The Meaning of Life
adler | From now on, the world is seen through a stable scheme of apperception: experiences are interpreted before they are accepted, and the interpretation always accords with the original meaning given to life. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Mistakes in the meaning given to life can be corrected only by reconsidering the situation in which the faulty interpretation was made, recognizing the error and revising the scheme of apperception. | The Meaning of Life
adler | No experience is a cause of success or failure. We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences — the so-called trauma — but we make out of them just what suits our purposes. | The Meaning of Life
adler | We are self-determined by the meaning we give to our experiences; and there is probably something of a mistake always involved when we take particular experiences as the basis for our future life. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Meanings are not determined by situations, but we determine ourselves by the meanings we give to situations. | The Meaning of Life
adler | It is from children in these situations that the majority of failures come. First we must take children with imperfect organs, suffering from diseases or infirmities during their infancy. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Unless there is someone near them who can draw their attention away from themselves and interest them in others, they are likely to occupy themselves mainly with their own sensations. | The Meaning of Life
adler | No imperfection of organs compels a mistaken style of life. We never find two children whose glands have the same effects on them. | The Meaning of Life
adler | It is mainly from those people who struggled hard against difficulties, in body as in outer circumstances, that advances and new contributions have come. | The Meaning of Life
adler | The second type of situation which often provides the occasion for a mistake in the meaning given to life is the situation of the pampered child. | The Meaning of Life
adler | The pampered child is trained to expect that his wishes will be treated as laws. He is granted prominence without working to deserve it and he will generally come to feel this prominence as a birthright. | The Meaning of Life
adler | His interest was devoted to himself and he never learned the use and the necessity of cooperation. | The Meaning of Life
adler | These grown-up pampered children are perhaps the most dangerous class in our community. | The Meaning of Life
adler | The third situation in which a mistake can easily be made is the situation of a neglected child. Such a child has never known what love and cooperation can be: he makes up an interpretation of life which does not include these friendly forces. | The Meaning of Life
adler | He has found society cold to him and he will expect it always to be cold. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Everybody has the capacity to be interested in others; but this capacity must be trained and exercised or its development will be frustrated. | The Meaning of Life
adler | These three situations—imperfect organs, pampering, and neglect—are a great challenge to give a mistaken meaning to life; and children from these situations will almost always need help in revising their approach to problems. | The Meaning of Life
adler | The greatest of all helps, however, in gaining a quick comprehension of the meaning an individual gives to himself and to life comes through his memories. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Every memory, however trivial he may think it, represents to him something memorable. It is memorable because of its bearing on life as he pictures it. | The Meaning of Life
adler | The memories of early childhood are especially useful in showing how long standing is the individual's own peculiar approach to life, and in giving the circumstances in which he first crystallized his life-attitude. | The Meaning of Life
adler | If once the meaning given to life is found and understood, we have the key to the whole personality. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Cooperation is also the only safeguard we have against the development of neurotic tendencies. | The Meaning of Life
adler | Only the individual who understands that life means contribution will be able to meet his difficulties with courage and with a good chance of success. | The Meaning of Life
adler | If life is approached in this way, as a cooperation of independent human beings, we can see no limits to the progress of our human association. | The Meaning of Life
adler | A courageous individual will show the effects of his attitude in his physique. | Mind and Body
adler | His body will be differently built up; the tonus of his muscles will be stronger, the carriage of his body will be firmer. | Mind and Body
adler | To-day it would be difficult to deny that the mind can influence the brain. | Mind and Body
adler | If the mind can exercise such an influence over the brain; if the brain is no more than the tool of the mind—its most important tool, but still only its tool—then we can find ways to develop and improve this tool. | Mind and Body
adler | No one born with a certain standard of brain need remain inescapably bound by it all his life: methods may be found to make the brain better fitted for life. | Mind and Body
adler | A mind which has fixed its goal in a mistaken direction—which, for example, is not developing the ability to cooperate—will fail to exercise a helpful influence on the growth of the brain. | Mind and Body
adler | Since the whole bearing of an adult reveals the influence of the style of life which he built up in the first four or five years, since we can see visibly before us the results of his scheme of apperception and the meaning which he has given to life, we can discover the blocks in cooperation from which he is suffering, and help to correct his failures. | Mind and Body
adler | Many authors have pointed out a constant relationship between the expressions of the mind and those of the body. | Mind and Body
adler | In the first four or five years of life the child unifies its mental strivings and establishes the root relationships between its mind and its body. | Mind and Body
adler | A fixed style of life is adopted, with a corresponding emotional and physical habitus. | Mind and Body
adler | In all failures the highest common measure is a small degree of ability to cooperate. | Mind and Body
adler | We can now give a still further definition of psychology: it is the understanding of deficiencies in cooperation. | Mind and Body
adler | Since the mind is a unity and the same style of life runs through all its expressions, all of an individual's emotions and thoughts must be consonant with his style of life. | Mind and Body
adler | We must never treat a Symptom or a single expression: we must discover the mistake made in the whole style of life, in the way the mind has interpreted its experiences, in the meaning it has given to life, and in the actions with which it has answered the impressions received from the body and from the environment. | Mind and Body
adler | This is the real task of psychology. It is not properly to be called psychology if we stick pins into a child and see how far it jumps, or tickle it and see how loud it laughs. | Mind and Body
adler | Styles of life are the proper subject-matter of psychology and the material for investigation; and schools which take any other subject-matter are occupied, in the main part, with physiology or biology. | Mind and Body
adler | In Individual Psychology, however, we are considering the psyche itself, the unified mind; we are examining the meaning which individuals give to the world and to themselves, their goals, the direction of their strivings, and the approaches they make to the problems of life. | Mind and Body
adler | The best key which we so far possess for understanding psychological differences is given by examining the degree of ability to cooperate. | Mind and Body
adler | One small incident is again made the reason for a whole attitude to life. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | If we consider it with common sense, we cannot see that the incident was sufficiently weighty to lead to such a conclusion. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | This girl, however, has secretly taken it as reason enough to dislike intoxicating beverages. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Probably she is really independent and likes to improve if she is in the wrong. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | It is as if she said, 'I make mistakes, but when I see they are mistakes I correct them.' | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | If this is so, she will be a very good type: active, courageous in her striving, improving her situation and looking always for the best way of living. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | In all these instances we are doing no more than training ourselves in the art of guessing. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | He wants to see others work; he himself wants only to sit by the window and watch them. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | If his condition is to be changed, we can do it only by freeing him from the belief that he cannot cooperate in the work of others. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | So far he has thought that the only way to live was to be supported by others. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | We must change his whole outlook. We shall accomplish nothing by reproaching him. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | His first memory, however, makes it easier for us to suggest work which will interest him. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | When he was cured, he found an occupation which lay along the line of this main interest. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | We can understand that he is in a much better situation with his lawsuit if he can show some disability. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Nobody likes to fall, but this man overemphasizes falling. He concentrates on the dangers of falling. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | He had gained his mother's attention by his fall; but the memory is also a reproach, 'She did not take good enough care of me.' | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | This is the style of life of a pampered child: he tries to make others responsible. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | He can be cured if he understands that this is a mistake: that there is no connection between falling and loss of speech. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | He was a child who wanted to be pampered, to be the center of attention. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | We can understand how he wants to be paid for his misfortunes. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | From this history we could already suspect that he had been pampered by his mother and that his father had tried to exert authority over him. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | We should probably find that his life was a revolt against the strictness of his father. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | He felt very deeply that he was dominated by all the family. His mother was his only friend. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | When we hear of an untidy child, we must always look for someone who tidies up for him. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | When we hear of a child who is afraid of the dark and does not like to be left alone, we must always look for someone whose attention he can attract and who will console him. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | At every point we can see that the purpose of his actions is to antagonize his father. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | He uses his early experience as a proof that his father is an enemy and his whole life has been a fight against him. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | Every suicide is a reproach; and by thinking of suicide he is saying, 'My father is guilty for everything.' | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | His dissatisfaction in his occupation is also directed against his father. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | He is a pampered child and he cannot be independent in his career. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | If he is sleepless, next day he is ill equipped for working. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | He must have an alibi; and this he gains by the apparently uninvited misfortune, sleeplessness. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | So long as all his interest goes towards irritating and defeating his father, nothing will come right. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | I show him the coherence of all his expressions — his uncertainty over his career, his thoughts of suicide, his running away from home, his sleeplessness. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | His mother has pampered him and his father has been unsympathetic. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | He has suffered from a mistaken training and a mistaken interpretation of his position. | Feelings of Inferiority and Superiority
adler | There is no mystical power in the skill of motherhood. All skill is the result of long interest and training. | Early Memories
adler | The preparation for motherhood begins very early in life. The first steps can be seen in a girl's attitude to younger children, her interest in babies and in her future tasks. | Early Memories
adler | It is never advisable to educate boys and girls as if they had precisely the same tasks ahead of them. | Early Memories
adler | Unfortunately it happens frequently in our culture that the part of a woman in motherhood is regarded as having only a minor value. | Early Memories
adler | If boys are preferred to girls, if their role is taken to be superior, it is natural for girls to dislike their future tasks. | Early Memories
adler | The whole of human society is bound up with the attitude of women to motherhood. | Early Memories
adler | Almost everywhere the woman's part in life is undervalued and treated as secondary. | Early Memories
adler | If a woman can really see housekeeping as an art in which she can be interested and through which she can lighten and enrich the lives of her fellows, she can make it a task equal to any other in the world. | Early Memories
adler | Where the woman's part is undervalued, the whole harmony of married life is destroyed. | Early Memories
adler | No woman who considers that to be interested in children is an inferior task can train herself for the skill, care, understanding and sympathy that are so necessary if children are to be given a favorable position in the beginning of their lives. | Early Memories
adler | If we trace back the cases of failure in life, we almost always discover that the mother did not fulfill her functions properly: she did not give the child a favorable start. | Early Memories
adler | If the mothers fail, if they are dissatisfied with their tasks and lack interest in them, the whole of mankind is endangered. | Early Memories
adler | It is not the child's experiences which dictate his actions; it is the conclusions which he draws from his experiences. | Early Memories
adler | We cannot say, for example, that if a child is badly nourished he will become a criminal. We must see what conclusion he has drawn. | Early Memories
adler | Investigations have made it clear that a mother's tendency to protect her children is stronger than all other tendencies. | Early Memories
adler | A mother often feels her child as a part of herself. Through her children she is connected with the whole of life; she feels herself the master of life and death. | Early Memories
adler | In every mother we could find, in one degree or another, the feeling that through her children she has accomplished a work of creation. | Early Memories
adler | The striving for motherhood is really one aspect of the human striving for superiority, the human goal of god-likeness. | Early Memories
adler | A mother, of course, may exaggerate a feeling that her child is a part of herself and press him into the service of her goal of personal superiority. | Early Memories
adler | We can begin to understand what a mistake is involved when a mother does not widen the connection she has made with her child and lead him to cooperate equally with the rest of his environment. | Early Memories
adler | If a mother considers only her tie with her children, she will be unable to avoid pampering and spoiling them. | Early Memories
adler | She must give the child his first experience of a trustworthy fellow being; and she must then be prepared to spread this trust and friendship until it includes the whole of our human society. | Early Memories
adler | In the Freudian theory of the Oedipus Complex, for example, it is supposed that children have a tendency to fall in love with their mothers and wish to marry them and to hate their fathers and wish to kill them. | Early Memories
adler | Such a mistake could never arise if we understood the development of children. The Oedipus Complex could appear only in a child who wished to occupy his mother's whole attention and get rid of everyone else. | Early Memories
adler | An Oedipus Complex would thus be always an artificial product of mistaken training. | Early Memories
adler | Pampered children are often afraid of being left alone and especially of being left alone in the dark. | Early Memories
adler | In Individual Psychology we no longer concern ourselves with finding out causes of fear, but rather with identifying its purpose. | Early Memories
adler | All pampered children suffer from fear: it is by means of their fears that they can attract attention and they build up this emotion into their style of life. | Early Memories
adler | A child that is timid is a child that has been pampered and wants to be pampered again. | Early Memories
adler | Sickness is often a refuge for pampered children; for when they are sick they are pampered more than ever. | Early Memories
adler | Oldest children, for example, often have dreams of falling. They are on top, but they are not sure that they can keep their superiority. | Dreams
adler | Second children, on the other hand, often picture themselves in races. They run after trains and ride in bicycle races. | Dreams
adler | Sometimes this hurry in his dreams is sufficient by itself to allow us to guess that the individual is a second child. | Dreams
adler | It is not only in the waking life that we see these characteristics. They leave their marks on all expressions of the personality and they are easily found in dreams. | Dreams
adler | Joseph's style of life is exactly typical of the style of life of a youngest. He is always asserting his superiority, even in his dreams. | Dreams
adler | The others must bow down before him; he outshines them all. His brothers understood his dreams very well. | Dreams
adler | It was not hard for them, since they had Joseph with them and his attitude was clear enough. | Dreams
adler | The feelings which Joseph aroused in his dreams they also had felt. They feared him and wanted to get rid of him. | Dreams
adler | We must say, however, that there are no fixed rules in this way. It is not only an actual oldest child that can behave like an oldest. | Dreams
adler | The situation counts, not the mere order of birth. In a large family a later child is sometimes in the situation of an oldest. | Dreams
adler | Always where two children grow up close together and separated from the others they will show the characteristics of an oldest and a second child. | Dreams
adler | The position of each child in the family still makes a great difference and each child will still grow up in quite a new situation. | Dreams
adler | We must insist again that the situation is never the same for two children in a family; and each child will show in his style of life the results of his attempts to adapt himself to his own peculiar circumstances. | Dreams
adler | The change always makes a great impression and we can often find in problem children, neurotics, criminals, drunkards and perverts that their difficulties began in such circumstances. | Dreams
adler | They were oldest children who felt very deeply the arrival of another child; and their sense of deprivation had molded their whole style of life. | Dreams
adler | Individual Psychology has opened up a very wide field for research work by inquiring into the advantages and disadvantages for children according to the order of their birth. | Dreams
adler | We want equal, independent and responsible collaborators in the common work of culture. | Family Influences
adler | We must find teachers who can train children not only to earn money but to work in ways beneficial to mankind. | Family Influences
adler | Children come to school who have been failures in family life; and their mistakes are not diminished, in spite of all the lectures and exhortations they get. | Family Influences
adler | We need the most intimate cooperation between the psychiatrist and the teacher. | Family Influences
adler | When the child first goes to school, he is facing a new test in social life; and this test will reveal any mistakes in his development. | Family Influences
adler | In this way we can see in his very first day at school the limits of social feeling in a pampered child. | Family Influences
adler | It is the task of schoolteachers to notice the difficulties of the children and to correct the mistakes of the parents. | Family Influences
adler | Every child who is backward but not definitely feeble-minded is hesitating before the problem of adjustment to social life; and the teacher is in the best position to help him to meet what is a new situation for him. | Family Influences
adler | He can never be interested by severity or punishment. | Family Influences
adler | It is mainly the children to whom school is thus made an artificially unpleasant environment who play truant, are bad pupils and give the appearance of being stupid and difficult to handle. | Family Influences
adler | We can see, in this situation, how children who are not taken into the class as part of the whole are provoked to train themselves towards a criminal career. | Family Influences
adler | If anyone is to blame, it is rather the teachers and parents who have not found the right method of interesting the children. | Family Influences
adler | The best way to teach subjects is in coherence with the rest of life, so that the children can see the purpose of the instruction and the practical value of what they are learning. | Family Influences
adler | Under our present system we generally find that when children first come to school they are more prepared for competition than for cooperation; and the training in competition continues throughout their schooldays. | Family Influences
adler | As the family should be a unit, with each member an equal part of the whole, so, too, should the class. | Family Influences
adler | Sometimes people doubt whether children can really be trained to understand one another and help in this way; but it is my experience that children often understand better than their elders. | Family Influences
adler | The Intelligence Quotient should not be regarded as fixing a limit, set by fate or by heredity, to the child's future achievements. | Family Influences
adler | The greatest difficulty in education is provided, not by the limitations of the child, but by what he thinks are his limitations. | Family Influences
adler | Of all mistakes made in education, the belief in hereditary limits to development is the worst. | Family Influences
adler | It is not the deficiency itself which affects the mind, but the child's attitude to his deficiency, and his consequent training. | Family Influences
adler | Behind every exceptional degree of ability we shall find, not an exceptional heredity, but a long interest and training. | Family Influences
adler | A teacher should know all of his pupils intimately or he will not be able to establish interest and cooperation. | Family Influences
adler | I do not think, however, that children who are not well prepared for school should be placed in slower classes. | Family Influences
adler | In principle, coeducation deserves every support. It is an excellent means for boys and girls to know each other better and to learn to cooperate with the other sex. | Family Influences
adler | The classroom is not the right place for sexual education; if a teacher speaks to the whole class he has no means of knowing that each child understands him in the right way. | Family Influences
adler | The child who has not learned to cooperate is the neurotic, the drunkard, the criminal or the suicide of later years. | Family Influences
adler | We can hope, however, to reach all the teachers and through them to reach all the children; to correct the mistakes which have already been made and to train the children for an independent, courageous and cooperative life. | Family Influences
adler | In this work, it seems to me, lies the greatest promise for the future welfare of mankind. | Family Influences
adler | For the most part a child is given more freedom and independence during his adolescence. | School Influences
adler | If the parents try to continue their supervision, however, the child will make still stronger efforts to avoid control. | School Influences
adler | Out of this struggle an antagonistic attitude develops; and we are then provided with the typical picture of 'adolescent negativism.' | School Influences
adler | We cannot place strict limits on the period of adolescence. It runs generally from about fourteen years of age to about twenty years. | School Influences
adler | Sometimes a child, badly prepared for adult life, feels himself in a panic at the approach of the problems of occupation, social life and society, love and marriage. | School Influences
adler | With regard to society, he is bashful and reserved, he isolates himself and stays at home. | School Influences
adler | With regard to occupation, he can find no work that attracts him and is sure that he would be a failure in everything. | School Influences
adler | With regard to love and marriage, he is embarrassed with the other sex and scared at meeting them. | School Influences
adler | At last he is completely blocked towards all the problems of life and no one can understand him any longer. | School Influences
adler | If it is possible to encourage such a child, to prove that he is not on the right path and to point out to him a better one, he can be cured. | School Influences
adler | All the dangers of adolescence come from a lack of proper training and equipment before the three problems of life. | School Influences
adler | Unless we can encourage him, every effort to help him will be a mistake and will damage him still further. | School Influences
adler | Crime is one of the easy escapes before the problems of life, and especially before the problem of economics and livelihood. | School Influences
adler | So it happens that between the ages of fourteen and twenty there is a great increase in the number of delinquents. | School Influences
adler | Every neurotic symptom is designed to provide a justification for a refusal to solve the problems of life, without lowering the sense of personal superiority. | School Influences
adler | Neurotic symptoms appear when an individual is confronted by social problems which he is not prepared to meet in a social way. | School Influences
adler | A great number of failures in adolescence come from the pampered children; and it is easy to see that the approach of adult responsibilities is an especial strain to them. | School Influences
adler | They reproach life for having deceived and failed them; they have been brought up in an artificially warm atmosphere and the air outside feels bitterly cold. | School Influences
adler | The children of whom most was expected begin to fail in their studies and their work; and children who had previously seemed less gifted begin to overtake them. | School Influences
adler | Many of them are completely hypnotized by this craving for appreciation. It is dangerous enough for a boy if he is only looking for praise. | School Influences
adler | I have often found girls who felt unappreciated at home beginning to have sex relations, not merely to prove that they are grown-up, but because they hope, by this means, to achieve at last a position in which they are appreciated. | School Influences
adler | There is an almost universal superstition that adolescence is a very special and peculiar time. | School Influences
adler | If we understand that condition rightly, we shall see that children are not affected at all by the facts of adolescence, except in so far as the social conditions call for a new adaptation from their style of life. | School Influences
adler | If the child has been trained to feel himself an equal member of society and to understand his task of contribution, adolescence will give him only an opportunity to begin his creative and independent solution of the adult problems of life. | School Influences
adler | All criminals are cowards. They are evading problems they do not feel strong enough to solve. | Adolescence
adler | Criminals think they are being courageous; but we should not be fooled in the same way. | Adolescence
adler | Crime is a coward's imitation of heroism. They are striving for a fictitious goal of personal superiority. | Adolescence
adler | We know that they are cowards, and if they were sure we knew it, it would be a big shock to them. | Adolescence
adler | We must disturb this common estimate of the criminal's courage and cleverness; but when are we to disturb it? | Adolescence
adler | Sometimes we must put the responsibility on the parents. Perhaps the mother was not skillful enough to draw the child to cooperate with herself. | Adolescence
adler | It is easy to see that in unhappy or broken marriages the cooperative spirit is not being properly developed. | Adolescence
adler | If you trace back the life of a criminal, you will almost always find that the trouble began in his early family experiences. | Adolescence
adler | It was not the environment itself that counted; but the child misunderstood his position and there was no one there by his side to explain it to him. | Adolescence
adler | It is always a difficulty for the other children if one child in the family is especially prominent or gifted. | Adolescence
adler | When a child who is lacking in cooperation goes to school, we can notice it in his behavior on the very first day. | Adolescence
adler | He cannot be interested in his school life, if he is all the time suffering new attacks on his courage and self-confidence. | Adolescence
adler | Often in the career of a criminal you will find that at the age of thirteen he was in the fourth grade and he was blamed for his stupidity. | Adolescence
adler | Poverty, also, offers opportunities for a mistaken interpretation of life. A child who comes from a poor home may meet social prejudice outside the home. | Adolescence
adler | It is not hard to understand why the number of criminals is so high in the big cities, where there are very noticeable extremes of poverty and luxury. | Adolescence
adler | No useful goal ever came from envy; but a child in these circumstances can easily misunderstand and think that the way to superiority is to get money without working for it. | Adolescence
adler | The feeling of inferiority can also be centered round an organic deficiency. This was one of my own discoveries. | Adolescence
adler | It is not the organism which is to blame, but our methods of education. If we used the right method, children with organic deficiencies would be interested in others as well as themselves. | Adolescence
adler | Among criminals there is a large proportion of orphans; and it seems to me a disgrace to our culture that we could not establish the spirit of cooperation in these orphans. | Adolescence
adler | Unwanted children often take to criminal practices, especially if they know and feel that nobody wanted them. | Adolescence
adler | But think what it feels like to be an ugly child! He is at a great disadvantage. | Adolescence
adler | But all these children, if they were treated in the right way, would develop social interest. | Adolescence
adler | You will find that criminals are divided into two types. There are those who do not know that there is fellow-feeling in the world and have never experienced it. | Adolescence
adler | The other type is the pampered child; and I have frequently noticed, in the complaints of prisoners, that they assert, 'The reason for my criminal career was that my mother pampered me too much.' | Adolescence
adler | If they pampered him and let him take the center of the stage, he was taught to consider himself important through the mere fact of his existence, without making any creative effort to deserve the good opinion of his fellows. | Adolescence
adler | Such children, therefore, lose the ability to struggle; they want always to have notice taken of them and are always expecting something. | Adolescence
adler | There is no other way than to improve his capacity for cooperation and to show him where his estimate of life is mistaken. | Adolescence
adler | We can convince him only when we trace back the misunderstandings of his earliest childhood. | Adolescence
adler | From the psychologist's standpoint, all harsh treatment in prison is a challenge. It is a trial of strength. | Adolescence
adler | In the education of problem children, too, it is one of the worst errors to challenge them: 'We'll see who is stronger! We'll see who can hold out longest!' | Adolescence
adler | In this history we can observe the roots in early childhood of his later career. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | He grew up overshadowed by an older brother, like a little tree overshadowed by a bigger one. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | The three main types of children with special difficulties are: first, children with imperfect organs; secondly, pampered children; and thirdly, neglected children. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | Children with imperfect organs feel deprived of their birthright by nature, and, unless their interest in others is specially trained, they are apt to be more than usually preoccupied with themselves. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | Pampered children remain anchored to the parents who spoil them � they cannot spread their interest to the rest of the world. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | It is easily understood that we find among criminals two main types � the Ugly-neglected and the Handsome-pampered. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | I have always found that the key of Individual Psychology can give us an understanding of the circumstances. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | Whenever I did anything wicked, I thought, No one is ever sorry for me: why should I worry if I make others sorry? | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | My advice is that you should begin and not care whether the others are cooperative. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | If it were fully recognized everywhere that crime is cowardice and not courage, I believe that the greatest self-justification would be taken away from criminals. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | In all criminal cases, whether they are correctly described or not, we can see the influence of a mistaken childhood style of life, a style showing a lack of the ability to cooperate. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | I should like to say that this ability to cooperate must be trained. There is no question of its being hereditary. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | The right protection against crime would be the right degree of cooperation. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | So long as this is not recognized, we cannot hope to avoid the disaster of crime. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | We have found that the criminal is not an exception to the human race; he is much like other people and his behavior is a comprehensible variety of human behavior. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | The criminal, we discovered, has trained himself for a long time in noncooperative thoughts and actions; and the roots of this lack of cooperation go back to his early childhood. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | The greatest common denominator among all the greatest varieties of criminals and among all failures of every kind is this lack of cooperation, lack of interest in other people and in the welfare of mankind. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | Everything depends from this single factor, the ability to cooperate. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | The criminal differs from other failures in one point. Through his old and continuous training against cooperation he has lost, as the others have also lost, the hope of achieving success in the normal tasks of life. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | We can see in this circumstance how much he is lacking in courage; and he is bound to lack courage, for courage is only a part of the ability to cooperate. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | The criminal begins to plot and prepare a crime when he is in a difficulty, has not the courage to face it in a cooperative way, and looks for an easy solution. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | His striving, however, is outside of the framework of society: his goal is a goal of imaginary personal superiority. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | In all this we can see his inferiority complex. He is running away from the conditions of labor and from the tasks of life in association. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | The criminal is really carrying out his life in a dream: he does not know reality; he must fight against knowing reality or he would be forced to give up his career. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | Neglected children, unwanted, unappreciated, or hated children, are in a similar situation: they have never experienced the cooperation of others; they have not learned that it is possible to be liked, to win affection, to solve problems by cooperation. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | Pampered children have not been taught to gain things by their own effort; they think that it is sufficient that they should want something and that the world should hasten to fulfill their demands. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | We must train them in cooperation. We have the knowledge, and by now we have enough experience. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | I am convinced that Individual Psychology shows us how we could change every single criminal. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | With regard to unemployment, for example, and the lack of occupational training and skill, we should make it possible that everyone who wants to work can secure a job. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | It is unquestionable that if this were done there would be a decrease in the number of criminals. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | If we could train our children to the right degree of ability to cooperate, if we could develop them in social interest, the number of criminals would diminish very considerably. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | The majority of criminals begin their careers very early. It is generally in adolescence that they start, and perhaps in the years between fifteen and twenty-eight crimes are most frequent. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | We can make teachers the instruments of our social progress: we can train our teachers to correct mistakes made in the family, to develop and spread the social interest of the children towards others. | Crime and Its Prevention
adler | If we lived on a planet which offered us everything we needed without work, it would perhaps be a virtue to be lazy and a vice to be industrious. | Occupation
adler | As far as we can understand from our relation to our own planet, earth, the logical answer to the problem of occupation, the only answer in accordance with common sense, is that we should work, cooperate and contribute. | Occupation
adler | This has always been felt in the intuitions of mankind: we can see its necessity, now, from the scientific angle. | Occupation
adler | Mankind only calls those individuals geniuses who have contributed much to the common welfare. | Occupation
adler | We cannot imagine a genius who has left no advantage to mankind behind him. | Occupation
adler | The arts are the product of the most cooperative of all individuals, and the great geniuses of mankind have raised the whole level of our culture. | Occupation
adler | There can be no question but that geniuses have been the most cooperative of all human beings. | Occupation
adler | In almost all outstanding people we find some organ imperfection; and we gather the impression that they were sorely confronted at the beginning of life but struggled and overcame their difficulties. | Occupation
adler | From this early training we can conclude that their art and their genius was their own creation, not an undeserved gift of nature or inheritance. | Occupation
adler | This early striving is the best foundation for later success. | Occupation
adler | If the value of money is overstressed in family life, the children will be tempted to look at the problem of occupation only in the light of the money they can make. | Occupation
adler | That everyone should earn his living is a truth; and it is true, also, that we find people who neglect this point and make themselves a charge on others. | Occupation
adler | But if a child is only interested in making money he can easily lose the path of cooperation and look only after his own advantages. | Occupation
adler | If 'to make money' is his only goal and no social interest is bound up with it, there is no possible reason why he should not make money by robbing and swindling other people. | Occupation
adler | An occupation can sometimes be used to evade and be made into an excuse for evading the problems of society and love. | Occupation
adler | Very often in our social life an exaggeration of activity in business can be chosen as a means to get rid of the problem of love and marriage. | Occupation
adler | Sometimes we find it used as an excuse for failure. A man devotes himself furiously to his business, and thinks, 'I have no time to spare for my marriage, and so I am not responsible for its unhappiness.' | Occupation
adler | Our first point with problem children is to find out their main interest. Through this it is easier to encourage them on the whole. | Occupation
adler | In cases of young people who have not been able to settle on an occupation, or older people who have been occupational failures, their real interest should be found out and used, in the right hands, to give them vocational guidance, combined with an effort to find them employment. | Occupation
adler | In our own time the great number of unemployed is a matter for alarm. This is not the right expression for a time in which people are trying to improve cooperation. | Occupation
adler | I believe therefore that everybody who has seen the importance of cooperation should strive to see that there are no unemployed individuals, that work is open to everybody who wants it. | Occupation
adler | We may be helped in this way by furthering movements for training schools, technical schools and adult education. | Occupation
adler | It is a great burden for mankind to have untrained members of society and members who are not interested in the common welfare. | Occupation
adler | Because of their lack of training, they lag in the rear of mankind. | Occupation
adler | All parents and teachers and all who are interested in the future development and improvement of mankind should make efforts that all children are better trained and that such a great number of them do not come into adult life with no special place in the division of labor. | Occupation
adler | If each partner is to be more interested in the other partner than in himself, there must be equality. | Love and Marriage
adler | Equality is only possible if both partners have this attitude. It should be the effort of each to ease and enrich the life of the other. | Love and Marriage
adler | Here we find the fundamental guarantee of marriage, the fundamental meaning of happiness in this relation. | Love and Marriage
adler | It is the feeling that you are worthwhile, that you cannot be replaced, that your partner needs you, that you are acting well, that you are a fellow man and a true friend. | Love and Marriage
adler | Two people cannot live together fruitfully if one wishes to rule and force the other to obey. | Love and Marriage
adler | This is the reason why we have so many unhappy marriages. Nobody can bear a position of inferiority without anger and disgust. | Love and Marriage
adler | Comrades must be equal, and when people are equal, they will always find a way to settle their difficulties. | Love and Marriage
adler | In our present-day civilization people are not often well prepared for cooperation. | Love and Marriage
adler | Our training has been too much towards individual success, towards considering what we can get out of life rather than what we can give to it. | Love and Marriage
adler | Most people are experiencing this close relationship for the first time. They are unaccustomed to consulting another human being's interests and aims, desires, hopes and ambitions. | Love and Marriage
adler | The preparation for marriage is not overnight. In a child's characteristic behavior, in his attitudes, thoughts and actions, we can see how he is training himself for adult situations. | Love and Marriage
adler | Early in the development of a child we can see that he is already forming his outlook on love and marriage. | Love and Marriage
adler | We should take it as a step forward in their preparation for love and marriage. Instead of making a trifle out of it, we should rather agree with the child that love is a marvelous task. | Love and Marriage
adler | Thus we can implant an ideal in the child's mind, and later in life children will be able to meet each other as very well-prepared comrades and as friends in an intimate devotion. | Love and Marriage
adler | I should never encourage parents to explain the physical relations of sex too early in life or to explain more than their children wish to learn. | Love and Marriage
adler | In my own experience children who were introduced to the facts of adult relations in early life, at four, five or six years of age, and children who had precocious experiences, are always more scared of love in later life. | Love and Marriage
adler | The key to helpfulness is never to lie to a child, never to evade his questions, to understand what is behind his questions, to explain only as much as he wishes to learn and only as much as we are sure he can understand. | Love and Marriage
adler | Children gain their earliest impression of what marriage is like from the life of their parents; and it is not astonishing that the greatest number of failures in life are among the children of broken marriages and unhappy family life. | Love and Marriage
adler | If the parents are not able themselves to cooperate, it will be impossible for them to teach cooperation to their children. | Love and Marriage
adler | The worst preparation is when an individual is always looking for his own interest. If he has been trained in this way, he will be thinking all the while what pleasure or excitement he can get out of life. | Love and Marriage
adler | A good marriage is the best means we have for bringing up the future generation of mankind; and marriage should always have this in view. | Love and Marriage
adler | It is impossible to have the real intimate devotion of love if we limit our responsibility to five years or regard the marriage as a trial period. | Love and Marriage
adler | We know what characteristics are necessary for a love partnership — to be faithful and true and trustworthy, not to be reserved, not to be self-seeking. | Love and Marriage
adler | It is not even possible to carry through a true comradeship if both partners have agreed to preserve their freedom. This is not comradeship. | Love and Marriage
adler | I believe that the intimate devotion of love and marriage is best secured if there have not been sexual relations before the marriage. | Love and Marriage
