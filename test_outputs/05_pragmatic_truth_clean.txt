I argue that the pragmatic conception of truth, which equates truth with usefulness, is fundamentally flawed. Pragmatism posits that the truth of a belief or proposition is determined by its practical effects, its usefulness in achieving certain ends. However, I believe this stance fails because usefulness is inherently variable, dependent on individual circumstances, and temporal contexts, whereas truth-values are constant across different contexts and individuals. This discrepancy highlights a significant limitation in the pragmatic approach to truth [P9].

To understand why truth cannot be equated with usefulness, consider the nature of truth-values in classical logic. Classical logic is characterized by explicit rules of inference, step-by-step deduction, binary truth values, context-independence, and compositional semantics [P1]. In this framework, a statement is either true or false, independent of external factors such as who is evaluating the statement or when it is being evaluated. This binary nature of truth-values ensures consistency and objectivity in logical reasoning and argumentation.

In contrast, the pragmatic view ties truth to the notion of usefulness, which can vary significantly across different situations. What is useful in one context may not be useful in another, and what is useful for one individual may not be useful for another. For instance, a belief that leads to a successful outcome in one scenario may lead to failure in another due to changed circumstances or different individual needs. Thus, the variability of usefulness undermines the stability and universality that truth-values are supposed to represent.

Moreover, the pragmatic conception of truth neglects the foundational aspect of truth in knowledge acquisition. While pragmatism correctly identifies the fundamentally interactive nature of knowledge acquisition [P10], it overlooks the role that stable truth-values play in facilitating this interaction. When acquiring knowledge, individuals rely on consistent truths to build upon existing understanding and to engage in meaningful communication with others. Without a stable foundation of truth-values, the process of knowledge acquisition becomes fragmented and unreliable.

Another critical issue with the pragmatic conception of truth is its inability to account for the distinction between semantics and pragmatics. In linguistic understanding, semantics refers to the meaning of linguistic expressions, while pragmatics concerns how context influences the interpretation of those expressions [P3]. I argue that some form of the semantics-pragmatics distinction captures real features of linguistic understanding [P4]. By equating truth with usefulness, pragmatism muddles this distinction, as it introduces context-dependent variables into what should be context-independent semantic evaluations.

The demonstrated capabilities of large language models provide empirical support for classical theories of meaning, particularly the distinction between semantics and pragmatics [P3]. These models can generate context-independent semantic evaluations, demonstrating that truth-values can be preserved independently of pragmatic variables such as usefulness. This empirical evidence further underscores the limitations of the pragmatic approach to truth.

Furthermore, I contend that reality is better understood through continuous properties rather than discrete categories that require multiple truth values [P7]. While the pragmatic conception of truth attempts to address the fuzziness of real-world categories by tying truth to usefulness, this approach is unnecessary if we recognize that underlying continuous properties can account for apparent vagueness. The architecture of successful AI systems supports this view, providing strong evidence that binary truth can be preserved while accounting for the apparent fuzziness of real-world categories through continuous underlying properties [P8].

Pragmatism's failure to accommodate the constancy of truth-values also affects its treatment of propositions. Propositions have decompositional structure, meaning they are not specified merely by their truth-conditions; their decomposition must also be given [Q7]. The pragmatic view, by focusing on usefulness, risks oversimplifying the complex structure of propositions and their role in conveying meaning and truth.

This simplification becomes evident in the pragmatic treatment of analytic propositions. If propositions were merely properties of worlds, as pragmatism might suggest, analytic propositions would \"disappear\"—they would tell us nothing since all worlds have them [Q9]. This issue highlights the inadequacy of pragmatism in dealing with the internal or decompositional differences between analytically equivalent propositions [Q8].

Additionally, the pragmatic conception of truth is challenged by the semantics of noun-phrases and their role in logical expressions. For instance, tokens of proper names are directly referential by way of encoding functions that assign truth to classes based on whether the named individual is a member [Q5]. This directly referential nature of proper names is not easily reconciled with a notion of truth tied to usefulness, as the reference and truth-conditions of proper names are independent of pragmatic considerations.

In my view, a more robust understanding of truth should recognize the distinction between truth-values and pragmatic usefulness while preserving the benefits of both approaches. While pragmatism offers valuable insights into the interactive nature of knowledge acquisition [P10], it should not do so at the expense of compromising the objective and stable nature of truth-values. By maintaining the distinction between truth and usefulness, we can better appreciate the complexities of linguistic understanding, logical reasoning, and knowledge acquisition.

In conclusion, the pragmatic conception of truth, which equates truth with usefulness, is inadequate due to the inherent variability of usefulness and its inability to account for stable truth-values. This conception undermines the objectivity and consistency that truth-values provide in logical reasoning and linguistic understanding. By recognizing the limitations of the pragmatic approach and embracing a view that preserves the constancy of truth-values while acknowledging the interactive nature of knowledge acquisition, we can achieve a more comprehensive and coherent understanding of truth.

In my exploration of truth and logic, I have consistently defended the concept of binary truth values, asserting that classical logic effectively maintains its integrity while accommodating the complexities of real-world phenomena. The essence of classical logic lies in its binary approach to truth values, where propositions are either true or false, and this framework provides a clear, structured methodology for reasoning and deduction [P1]. The binary nature of truth values is not merely a theoretical abstraction but a practical necessity for coherent and reliable reasoning.

The critique of binary truth values often stems from the observation that real-world categories are not always clear-cut, leading some to propose alternative logics that allow for degrees of truth or multiple truth values. However, I argue that binary truth values can be preserved by understanding reality through continuous properties rather than discrete categories [P7]. This approach allows us to account for the apparent fuzziness of real-world categories without abandoning the binary structure that underpins classical logic.

Continuous properties provide a nuanced framework for understanding phenomena that might seem vague or indeterminate when viewed through a discrete lens. By representing properties on a continuum, we can preserve the binary nature of truth while acknowledging the complexity of the real world. This perspective aligns with the architecture of successful AI systems, which demonstrate that binary truth can coexist with the fuzziness of real-world categories through underlying continuous properties [P8].

The use of continuous properties does not undermine the principle of binary truth but rather enhances our ability to apply it effectively. Consider the example of color perception: rather than categorizing colors into discrete groups, we can understand them as points on a spectrum. While the perception of color may vary, the underlying reality of the electromagnetic spectrum is continuous. This continuity allows us to make precise distinctions and maintain binary truth values when describing specific instances within this spectrum.

Furthermore, the pragmatic conception of truth, which equates truth with usefulness, fails to provide a stable framework for truth values. Usefulness is inherently variable, depending on individual preferences and contextual factors, whereas truth values remain constant [P9]. This inconsistency highlights the limitations of pragmatism in accurately capturing the nature of truth. Instead, by adhering to binary truth values, we maintain a consistent and objective standard for evaluating propositions.

In my critique of pragmatism, I acknowledge its insight into the interactive nature of knowledge acquisition but reject its reduction of truth to mere usefulness [P10]. Pragmatism correctly emphasizes the role of human interaction and experience in shaping understanding, yet it overlooks the necessity of objective truth values in providing a stable foundation for knowledge. The variability of usefulness cannot substitute for the constancy of truth values, which remain unchanged regardless of personal or situational differences.

The distinction between semantics and pragmatics further supports the defense of binary truth values. Large language models, which embody classical theories of meaning, demonstrate the empirical validity of distinguishing between the two [P3]. Semantics involves the inherent meaning of expressions, which aligns with binary truth values, while pragmatics considers the context and usage of language. By separating these aspects, we can preserve the binary nature of truth in semantics while accommodating the variability of pragmatic interpretation.

Moreover, the semantics-pragmatics distinction captures real features of linguistic understanding [P4]. It allows us to differentiate between the literal meaning of statements and their contextual implications, ensuring that binary truth values are applied consistently to the semantic content. This distinction is crucial in maintaining the integrity of binary truth values, as it prevents the conflation of context-dependent variability with the objective evaluation of truth.

In the realm of geometry, Euclid's axiomatization serves as a historical example of the power of binary truth values [P5]. Euclid did not discover new geometric truths but provided a systematic method for organizing and deriving pre-existing knowledge. His work exemplifies the application of binary truth values in formalizing knowledge, demonstrating their efficacy in structuring complex systems of thought. The clarity and precision afforded by binary truth values are essential in constructing logical frameworks that withstand scrutiny and facilitate understanding.

While higher-order thought theories suggest that consciousness involves explicit thoughts about mental states, I argue that this is not necessary for self-reference or reflection [P6]. The essence of consciousness can be understood without resorting to complex, higher-order representations, allowing us to maintain a binary approach to truth in examining mental phenomena. By focusing on the direct, first-order experiences of consciousness, we avoid unnecessary complications and preserve the simplicity and clarity of binary truth values.

The application of binary truth values extends beyond abstract reasoning to practical domains such as artificial intelligence. Successful AI systems rely on binary truth values to process information and make decisions, illustrating their utility in complex, real-world scenarios [P8]. These systems demonstrate that binary truth values are not only theoretically sound but also practically effective, providing a robust framework for navigating the intricacies of reality.

Binary truth values are not an outdated relic of classical logic but a fundamental aspect of coherent reasoning and understanding. By recognizing the role of continuous properties, distinguishing between semantics and pragmatics, and critiquing alternative conceptions of truth, I affirm the enduring relevance and necessity of binary truth values. They provide a stable foundation for knowledge, ensuring consistency and objectivity in the evaluation of propositions. In defending binary truth values, I uphold the integrity of classical logic while accommodating the complexities of the real world.

I believe that understanding reality through continuous properties offers a more accurate representation than discrete categories that rely on multiple truth values. My view is that classical logic, while useful, is limited by its strict adherence to binary truth values, which can oversimplify the complexities of real-world phenomena [P1]. Reality, as I see it, is inherently more nuanced and better captured by continuous properties that allow for a spectrum of possibilities rather than a binary outcome [P7].

In practical terms, this means that while binary truth values serve as a foundational element in classical logic, they can coexist with a more refined understanding of reality through the lens of continuity. This approach doesn't discard binary truth values; rather, it integrates them into a broader framework that accounts for the apparent fuzziness and variability we observe in the world around us [P8]. For instance, when dealing with categories like \"tall\" or \"rich,\" which are inherently vague, continuous properties allow us to navigate these concepts more effectively by providing a gradation rather than a simple true/false dichotomy.

Moreover, the architecture of successful AI systems supports this perspective by demonstrating that binary truth can be preserved within systems that also accommodate continuous properties. These systems highlight how we can maintain the integrity of binary logic while embracing the complexity of real-world categories [P8]. My critique of pragmatism further underscores this point. By rejecting the idea that truth is merely about usefulness, I emphasize that truth-values remain constant, unlike usefulness, which varies by person and time [P9]. This constancy can be reconciled with the fluidity of continuous properties, offering a robust framework for understanding the intricacies of reality.
