Pragmatism has long held that the truth of a proposition is determined by its practical consequences or utility. However, this conception of truth is problematic because usefulness can vary significantly between different individuals and over time, whereas truth-values are constant and independent of such fluctuations.\n\nThe pragmatist view suggests that if a belief or statement is useful, it is true. However, usefulness is a subjective measure and can be influenced by personal biases, cultural contexts, and temporal circumstances. For example, a belief might be useful for a particular individual or group at a specific time but not useful for another individual or group, or at another time. This variability undermines the idea that usefulness can serve as a reliable indicator of truth. Truth, on the other hand, is binary and objective; a statement is either true or false regardless of individual perceptions or situational contexts [P8].\n\nFurthermore, the equating of truth with usefulness fails to account for the fact that some truths may not have immediate practical utility but are nonetheless true. For instance, many scientific discoveries initially have no apparent practical application but are later found to be of significant value. This indicates that truth and usefulness are not synonymous, as pragmatism suggests, but rather distinct concepts that may occasionally overlap [P10].\n\nI also believe that reducing the concept of truth to mere usefulness ignores the intrinsic value of truth as a fundamental aim of inquiry. The pursuit of truth is a central goal in many domains, including science, philosophy, and everyday reasoning. Viewing truth merely as a tool for achieving practical ends diminishes its status as a primary objective of intellectual endeavor.\n\nIn technological development, usefulness often serves as a leading indicator of truth. Practical success can precede theoretical understanding, as demonstrated by the history of technological advancements [P10]. However, this does not imply that usefulness is equivalent to truth. Instead, usefulness can sometimes guide us toward truth by highlighting areas where our understanding is correct or needs refinement.\n\nThe architecture of successful AI systems provides evidence that binary truth can be preserved while accounting for the apparent fuzziness of real-world categories through continuous underlying properties [P8]. This suggests that it is possible to maintain a clear distinction between truth and usefulness while acknowledging the complexity of real-world phenomena.\n\nThe pragmatist approach also overlooks the importance of the semantics-pragmatics distinction in understanding linguistic meaning [P4]. Semantics involves the study of meaning in language, while pragmatics focuses on how context influences interpretation. This distinction is crucial in analyzing how language conveys truth, independent of its practical implications. By conflating truth with usefulness, pragmatism fails to appreciate the nuanced ways in which language can express truths that are not immediately tied to practical outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, the pragmatist position does not adequately address the role of truth in moral and ethical reasoning. Moral truths, if they exist, may not always align with what is useful or beneficial for individuals or society at large. A moral principle might be true even if acting on it leads to undesirable consequences. The pragmatist view struggles to accommodate such cases, where truth and usefulness diverge.\n\nIn my view, a more robust understanding of truth recognizes its independence from subjective measures of usefulness. This perspective allows for a clearer distinction between what is true and what is merely expedient or advantageous. By maintaining this distinction, we preserve the integrity of truth as a guiding principle in our intellectual and practical pursuits.\n\nFurthermore, the pragmatist notion of truth as usefulness risks conflating epistemic and pragmatic justifications. Epistemic justification concerns the evidence or reasons supporting a belief's truth, whereas pragmatic justification pertains to the practical benefits of holding a belief. Confusing these two types of justification can lead to erroneous conclusions about the nature of truth.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a scenario in which believing a falsehood brings about positive outcomes. According to pragmatic criteria, the belief is justified because it is useful. However, this does not change the fact that the belief is false. By contrast, epistemic justification would require evidence supporting the belief's truth, independent of its practical benefits. This distinction highlights the limitations of a purely pragmatic conception of truth.\n\nIn conclusion, I contend that truth should not be conflated with usefulness. While usefulness can be an indicator of truth in some contexts, it is not synonymous with truth. The constancy of truth-values contrasts with the variability of usefulness, underscoring the need for a clear separation between these concepts. By recognizing the limitations of pragmatism's traditional tenet, we can better appreciate the complexities of truth and its role in guiding inquiry and understanding [P9][P10].\n\nIn addressing the topic of binary truth and vagueness, I must confront the longstanding philosophical tension between classical logic's rigid truth values and the fuzzy nature of real-world categories. I assert that the architecture of successful AI systems provides compelling evidence that binary truth can be preserved even while accounting for the apparent vagueness of everyday concepts through continuous underlying properties [P8]. This perspective challenges the notion that truth must be fluid and context-dependent to accommodate the complexities of reality.\n\nClassical logic, with its binary truth values, operates on the principle that propositions are either true or false and does not inherently accommodate for vagueness. This dichotomy is characterized by explicit rules of inference, step-by-step deduction, context-independence, and compositional semantics [P1]. While this system has its limitations, particularly in dealing with nuanced real-world scenarios, I argue that it remains a robust framework for understanding truth when augmented with additional considerations.\n\nThe idea that truth should be binary might seem at odds with how we experience the world, which often appears continuous rather than discrete. Real-world categories, like the concept of \tallness,\ do not lend themselves easily to binary classification. Instead, they introduce gradations and subjective thresholds. However, I argue that these gradations can be understood as manifestations of continuous properties that underlie discrete truth values [P8]. By recognizing the continuity in properties such as height, we can reconcile the apparent fuzziness with the binary nature of truth.\n\nMoreover, the success of AI systems reinforces the viability of maintaining binary truth while dealing with vagueness. AI architectures often employ neural networks that process information in a manner inspired by the brain's continuous operations. These systems can handle vagueness by learning from data and capturing the underlying continuous properties of categories, thereby allowing for binary decisions that are informed by a nuanced understanding of the input data [P8]. Thus, the empirical success of AI provides a model for how binary truth and vagueness can coexist.\n\nWhile pragmatism posits that truth is tied to usefulness, I critique this view because usefulness is not a stable measure. What is useful can vary significantly between individuals and over time, whereas truth-values, by definition, remain constant [P9]. The pragmatic approach suggests that the truth of a proposition is determined by its practical consequences, which I find inadequate. Truth should not be contingent on shifting utility; it must stand independent of human aims and preferences.\n\nNevertheless, I acknowledge that usefulness can serve as an indicator of truth, especially in technological development where practical success often precedes theoretical understanding [P10]. In these scenarios, the utility of a concept or technology hints at an underlying truth, but it does not define it. The distinction is crucial: usefulness might guide us to truth, but it does not constitute truth itself.\n\nIn the realm of language, the distinction between semantics and pragmatics further illustrates how binary truth can accommodate context without losing its foundational rigidity. Semantics deals with meaning as it is directly related to language structure, while pragmatics considers the context in which language is used [P3]. The delineation between these two aspects of linguistic analysis underscores the importance of context in interpreting statements without abandoning binary truth. The semantics-pragmatics distinction, therefore, reflects a real feature of linguistic understanding that supports my position that truth remains binary even in the face of contextual variability [P4].\n\nFurthermore, linguistic tokens, such as proper names and quantifiers, demonstrate how binary truth can operate within a unified semantic framework [Q2], [Q3], [Q4]. For example, a token of \Plato\ in a sentence functions to assign truth based on whether Plato belongs to a particular class, thereby preserving the binary nature of truth while interacting with the world contextually [Q2]. Similarly, quantifiers like \some\ and \every\ denote functions that assign truth to classes based on their instantiation status, further illustrating the binary underpinning in linguistic expressions [Q3], [Q4].\n\nIn exploring the nature of propositions, I emphasize that propositions possess a decompositional structure that is not solely defined by truth-conditions [Q7]. This decomposition is essential to understanding the unity and function of propositions within language, as they are not merely properties of worlds but have internal structures that must be considered. The Lewisian analysis, which treats propositions as sets of worlds, fails to accommodate these internal differences, highlighting the importance of a more nuanced understanding of propositions that aligns with binary truth [Q8], [Q9].\n\nThe notion that analytic propositions would \disappear\ if viewed purely as properties of worlds further supports my stance that binary truth is essential for maintaining the meaningfulness of propositions [Q9]. Without recognizing the decompositional structure, analytically equivalent propositions would offer no substantive information, underscoring the necessity of truth as instantiatedness and the unity of the proposition [Q7].\n\nIn conclusion, while the world presents us with complex, often vague scenarios, the binary nature of truth remains a fundamental aspect of logical and linguistic analysis. By acknowledging continuous properties underlying real-world categories and utilizing successful AI models as evidence, I maintain that binary truth can coexist with vagueness. This coexistence does not necessitate a departure from classical logic but rather an extension of its principles to encompass the nuanced realities we encounter. Despite the allure of pragmatism's tie between truth and usefulness, I argue for a clear distinction between the two, asserting that truth must remain constant and independent of fluctuating utility. Through the lens of semantics and pragmatics, I reinforce the idea that binary truth, when properly understood, can effectively capture the complexities of language and meaning without succumbing to the inherent vagueness of everyday life.\n\nI argue that usefulness serves as a leading indicator of truth, particularly in the realm of technological development, where practical success often precedes theoretical understanding [P10]. This perspective does not mean that truth is synonymous with usefulness, but rather that usefulness can guide us toward truth. The distinction is crucial because it addresses a common misconception within pragmatism that equates truth directly with practical utility.\n\nPragmatism traditionally holds that truth is determined by a proposition's practical consequences and utility. However, I critique this view because usefulness can vary between individuals and over time, whereas truth-values remain constant [P9]. A proposition can be useful in one context and not in another, but its truth-value does not fluctuate in the same manner. This constancy of truth even amid varying utility is a fundamental aspect of classical logic, which I support because it provides a stable framework for understanding propositions [P1].\n\nThe architecture of successful AI systems exemplifies how binary truth can coexist with apparent real-world vagueness through continuous underlying properties [P8]. These systems often operate on classical logic principles, using binary truth values to make decisions despite the fuzziness of input data. This suggests that while practical applications drive the development of AI, the underlying truths guiding their operation are not contingent on their immediate usefulness.\n\nIn technological contexts, the initial utility of a concept or device often leads to deeper insights into its truth. For example, consider how early practical applications of electricity led to a more profound understanding of electromagnetism. The utility of early electrical devices indicated underlying truths about electrical phenomena, which were later formalized through scientific theories. Here, usefulness served as a precursor to more comprehensive truth, illustrating how practical success can illuminate fundamental truths.\n\nHowever, this relationship between usefulness and truth should not be misconstrued as equating the two. While utility can guide us toward truth, it does not define it. Instead, utility acts as a heuristic in our pursuit of truth, pointing us toward propositions that are likely to be true based on their practical success. This approach maintains the integrity of truth as a stable, context-independent concept while acknowledging the role of usefulness in discovering it.\n\nIn summary, I maintain that usefulness is a valuable indicator of truth, especially in fields driven by practical application and innovation. However, truth itself is not contingent upon utility; it remains a constant, guiding principle that transcends the shifting landscape of practical needs and applications. This understanding allows us to appreciate the role of usefulness in guiding discovery without conflating it with the nature of truth itself.
