Hume and Locke, as staunch empiricists, sought to ground knowledge in sensory experience, effectively seeking to empiricize philosophy [Q6], [Q7]. However, in doing so, they inadvertently set the stage for philosophy's collapse into skepticism [Q9]. I argue that Hume's approach to causation is overly restrictive, as it fails to account for the necessity of theoretical frameworks that extend beyond mere sensory experience.\n\nHume famously argued that our understanding of causation is derived from the constant conjunction of events—essentially, we come to associate cause and effect through repeated observation of one event following another. While this empirical basis is straightforward, it overlooks the complexity of causation, which cannot be fully explained by mere observation. I assert that theoretical frameworks are essential for a robust understanding of causation, as they provide the necessary structure to interpret and contextualize empirical data [P9].\n\nEmpiricism, by its nature, limits itself to the sensory experiences available to an individual. This limitation becomes problematic when addressing the concept of causation, which often involves unseen mechanisms and relationships that transcend immediate sensory input. The Deductive-Nomological (DN) model, for example, requires complete laws to identify causes, but this requirement is unrealistic and impractical in real-world scenarios [P9]. We can identify causes without knowing exact conditions or precise laws because theoretical frameworks help bridge the gap between empirical observation and causal understanding.\n\nIn critiquing Hume's empiricism, I emphasize that causation involves more than just empirical observation. It requires an understanding of continuity, natural kinds, and implicit theoretical components [P1], [P5]. Hume's reduction of causation to constant conjunction fails to account for these elements, which are crucial for a holistic understanding of how the world operates. Theoretical frameworks about causation and continuity, which are implicitly understood even in AI systems, are necessary for grasping the causal relationships in the world [P1], [P3].\n\nFurthermore, Hume's empiricism does not adequately address the normative aspects of knowledge acquisition. People often make inferences based on norms, even when these norms lead to invalid conclusions [Q3]. These norm-driven reactions highlight the limitations of a purely empirical approach, as they demonstrate that human reasoning involves more than just sensory data—it also includes normative frameworks that guide and influence our understanding of the world.\n\nHume's skepticism about metaphysical necessity also highlights a significant limitation of his empiricism. He posited that no metaphysically necessary relation could exist between cause and effect unless one makes up the other [A5]. This view restricts the scope of philosophically meaningful discourse about causation, as it dismisses the possibility of necessary connections that are not immediately observable. In contrast, I argue that understanding causation requires acknowledging the underlying structures and principles that govern interactions, which may not always be apparent through empirical observation alone.\n\nIn modern AI research, these theoretical considerations are crucial. Successful AI systems incorporate implicit theoretical frameworks about causation, continuity, and natural kinds, allowing them to make predictions and understand relationships in a way that mirrors human cognition [P1], [P6]. For instance, when AI systems track multiple objects through occlusion, they demonstrate an understanding of continuity that enables causal knowledge [P7]. This process mirrors human cognition more closely than the simplistic empirical model proposed by Hume.\n\nMoreover, the limitations of Hume's empiricism are evident in the grue problem, where AI systems, like humans, favor the prediction of 'green' over 'grue' because their bias emerges from implicit theoretical frameworks about causation and continuity [P3]. This preference cannot be explained by sensory experience alone; it requires a conceptual understanding that extends beyond empirical observation.\n\nThe color properties example further illustrates the inadequacy of Hume's approach. Color properties do not change discontinuously without cause, and AI systems develop this understanding implicitly, recognizing the causal relationship between continuity and change [P4]. This understanding is not derived from sensory experience alone but from an implicit grasp of causation and continuity that Hume's empiricism fails to capture.\n\nIn the realm of language and understanding, Hume's empiricism also falls short. Modern language models succeed not through pure statistical analysis but by integrating patterns with conceptual understanding about objects, size relationships, and causation [P6]. This success underscores the necessity of theoretical frameworks that go beyond empirical observation, suggesting that a purely empirical approach is insufficient for understanding the complexities of language and cognition.\n\nThe broken clock analogy further exemplifies the limitations of justification based solely on empirical observation [P8]. If John relies on a broken clock, his belief about the time is unjustified, even if it happens to be correct. This scenario highlights the need for a deeper understanding of justification that transcends empirical data, incorporating theoretical insights about reliability and causation.\n\nIn summary, Hume's empiricist approach, while foundational in its emphasis on sensory experience, lacks the theoretical depth required to fully understand causation and other complex phenomena. By reducing causation to constant conjunction and neglecting the necessity of theoretical frameworks, Hume's approach limits philosophical inquiry and leads to skepticism [Q9]. In contrast, I advocate for a model that integrates empirical observation with theoretical insights, providing a more comprehensive understanding of causation and cognition. This model is evident in modern AI systems, which successfully incorporate theoretical frameworks to achieve human-like understanding and reasoning [P1], [P6]. By acknowledging the limitations of Hume's empiricism and embracing the necessity of theoretical frameworks, we can advance our understanding of the world in meaningful and insightful ways.\n\nI argue that empiricism, as a philosophical approach, imposes significant limitations on our understanding of causation. Empiricism posits that knowledge is primarily derived from sensory experience. However, this perspective is insufficient for explaining the complexities of causal relationships. Empiricists like Locke and Hume have historically attempted to reduce philosophical inquiry to what can be directly observed and experienced [Q6]. Yet, this reductionist view collapses into skepticism because it disregards the necessity of theoretical frameworks that transcend mere empirical data [Q9].\n\nCausation involves more than just the observation of events occurring in conjunction. For an adequate understanding of causation, we must recognize the implicit theoretical components that guide our interpretations and predictions. These components include notions of causation, continuity, and explanation [P5]. Empiricism, by its nature, struggles to incorporate these abstract elements because they are not directly observable. Instead, they are conceptual tools that help us make sense of the empirical world.\n\nConsider the example of artificial intelligence (AI). AI systems require more than just raw data input; they need to incorporate theoretical frameworks about causation, continuity, and natural kinds to achieve success [P1]. AI's reliance on these frameworks demonstrates that understanding causation is not solely a matter of empirical observation but also involves conceptual understanding. For instance, when AI systems predict future events, they do so by implicitly relying on theoretical assumptions about how the world works, which go beyond empirical data [P3]. This illustrates that causation cannot be fully understood through empiricism alone.\n\nHume's approach to causation famously revolves around the idea of constant conjunction—where causation is understood as the regular succession of events. However, this view is overly restrictive because it fails to capture the necessity and universality that we typically associate with causal relationships. Hume's skepticism about causation arises from his insistence that we cannot perceive necessary connections between events, only their constant conjunction [A5]. This perspective overlooks the role of theoretical frameworks in establishing causal links that are not immediately observable but are inferred through reasoning and understanding.\n\nThe limitations of empiricism become even more apparent when examining how humans and AI systems alike favor certain predictions over others. For example, both tend to favor predictions based on continuity and causation rather than arbitrary or discontinuous changes, such as in the \grue\ problem [P3]. This preference is not rooted in empirical observation alone but arises from an implicit understanding of how the world is structured. The grue problem highlights that our predictive successes involve theoretical assumptions about the stability and continuity of natural kinds, which empiricism by itself cannot adequately explain.\n\nFurthermore, color perception provides another case where empiricism falls short. Color properties are perceived as stable and continuous, which implies an underlying causal structure that does not change without cause [P4]. This understanding of color is not derived solely from sensory experience but involves conceptual knowledge about the nature of objects and their properties. AI systems, like humans, develop this understanding implicitly, which suggests that causation and continuity are theoretical constructs that guide our interpretation of empirical data.\n\nThe distinction between empirical and empirically motivated theories is crucial here. A failure to understand this distinction has led to misguided theories in various domains, such as in the philosophy of mathematics, where Mill's empiricism and Hilbert's formalism have resulted in inadequate explanations of mathematical truth [Q2]. Similarly, in the realm of causation, relying solely on empirical observation without considering the motivating theoretical frameworks leads to incomplete and often erroneous conclusions.\n\nThe limitations of empiricism are particularly evident in the context of language models and their processing capabilities. Modern language models succeed not through pure statistical analysis but by integrating patterns with a conceptual understanding of objects, size relationships, and causation [P6]. This integration is necessary for the models to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Empiricism, with its emphasis on sensory experience, cannot account for the depth of understanding required for such tasks, which involves theoretical reasoning beyond mere observation.\n\nIn practical terms, identifying causes in real-world scenarios often does not require knowing exact conditions or precise laws, as the Deductive-Nomological (DN) model suggests [P9]. Empiricism's demand for complete laws is unrealistic because it ignores the role of intuition, judgment, and conceptual reasoning in causal identification. We can confidently identify causes based on partial information and inferred connections, which empiricism alone cannot justify.\n\nMoreover, the broken clock case illustrates the limitations of justification involving falsehoods. If John relies on a broken clock that happens to show the correct time by coincidence, his belief is not truly justified, and if he continues to rely on it, he will likely be wrong in the future [P8]. This example underscores that empirical observation without a sound theoretical basis is unreliable. Justification and understanding require more than empirical data; they need a framework that integrates empirical evidence with theoretical reasoning.\n\nThe empiricist agenda pursued by philosophers like Locke and Hume aims to empiricize philosophy, reducing it to what can be observed and measured [Q10]. However, this approach has led to the collapse of philosophy into skepticism, as it fails to account for the theoretical elements that underpin our understanding of the world [Q9]. Causation, as a concept, cannot be fully understood through empirical observation alone. It requires a theoretical framework that incorporates notions of necessity, continuity, and explanation, which extend beyond the empirical realm.\n\nIn summary, empiricism, while valuable in grounding knowledge in sensory experience, is limited in its capacity to explain causation adequately. Theoretical frameworks are essential for understanding the complexities of causal relationships, as they provide the necessary conceptual tools to interpret and predict empirical phenomena. By recognizing the limitations of empiricism and embracing the role of theoretical reasoning, we can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of causation that aligns with both human cognition and the requirements of successful AI systems. Empiricism's reductionist approach, as exemplified by Hume's constant conjunction, is insufficient for capturing the richness of causal understanding, which inherently involves theoretical elements that transcend mere observation.
