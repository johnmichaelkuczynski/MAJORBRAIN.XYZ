System L highlights a crucial difference: while discovery involves the methods we use to find new insights or solutions, verification concerns how we confirm or validate these findings. I argue that this distinction is not merely academic but has significant implications for how we understand and practice logic, mathematics, and even artificial intelligence.\n\nSystem L uses inductive methods for discovery and deductive methods for verification when working in deductive domains [P2]. This is crucial because it acknowledges the different cognitive processes involved in coming up with new ideas versus proving them. Inductive methods are exploratory. They allow us to notice patterns, draw analogies, and make educated guesses. These are the tools of discovery, where the goal is to generate new hypotheses or insights. In contrast, deductive methods are rigorous and systematic, used to establish the validity of a proposition beyond doubt.\n\nMathematicians rarely proceed by pure deduction; they often rely on pattern recognition, analogy, intuition, and educated guesses to arrive at new theorems or solutions [P3]. This process is inherently inductive. The mathematician's insight about how to prove a theorem often comes through pattern recognition or analogy, but this insight isn't itself the proof—it's a guide to where the proof might be found [P4]. This demonstrates the interplay between discovery and verification. The insight guides the deductive process necessary for verification, but it does not serve as the justification for the theorem itself.\n\nIn reasoning, the real error of psychologism isn't the use of psychological or empirical insights; the error is treating such insights as justifications rather than as tools of discovery [P5]. This is an important point because it helps clarify the role of intuition and creativity in the discovery process. These elements are crucial for generating new ideas but must be distinguished from the rigorous methods required for verification. Treating psychological insights as justifications conflates discovery with verification and undermines the integrity of logical reasoning.\n\nThe Prior Knowledge Principle is another concept that plays a critical role in distinguishing between discovery and verification. It states that if using a formal system requires us to already know what we're trying to find out, that system fails as a tool of discovery [P6]. This principle underscores the necessity of discovery processes being genuinely exploratory, allowing us to find new knowledge rather than merely confirming what we already know.\n\nI have critiqued Popper's strict separation between contexts of discovery and justification, arguing that such a division cannot be maintained [P7]. Discovery and justification are not categorically distinct processes but rather interrelated aspects of theoretical reasoning [P10]. The features that make a hypothesis worth considering are inherently connected to what justifies it [P9]. This interrelation challenges Popper's view and suggests that the processes of discovery and justification often inform and shape each other.\n\nDiscovery processes in artificial intelligence also illustrate this interrelation. These processes follow identifiable logical principles, incorporate domain knowledge, respect causal and explanatory constraints, and maintain internal coherence [P8]. This demonstrates that even in AI, discovery is not a purely isolated process; it is intertwined with principles that also play a role in justification.\n\nIn the realm of semantics, I have opposed the notion of introducing a massive, implausible cleavage into a unified class of sentences by distinguishing between 'sentences₁' and 'sentences₂' [Q3]. Instead, it is better to treat all sentences uniformly as having a two-dimensional structure. This approach aligns with my view of the interconnectedness of discovery and justification, as it avoids unnecessary distinctions that complicate our understanding without adding explanatory value.\n\nFurthermore, my critique of Jackson and Pettit's attempt to save externalism via \"program causes\" illustrates the importance of not conflating causal efficacy with causal relevance [Q4]. This distinction is analogous to the one between discovery and verification, where causal relevance might inform our understanding (discovery) but does not necessarily provide the justification (verification) for externalist claims.\n\nThe example of \"Hesperus might not have been Phosphorus\" further underscores the importance of distinguishing between discovery and justification [Q5]. While it is absurd to claim that a thing can be other than itself, it is not absurd to explore our epistemic situation. In this case, the perceptions associated with \"Hesperus\" and \"Phosphorus\" could have been caused by two distinct objects. This exploration is part of the discovery process, while the realization that they are the same object is part of the justification process.\n\nThe wide-scope/narrow-scope distinction helps explain the phenomenon of \"necessary a posteriori\" statements [Q6]. Giving the necessity operator the narrowest scope yields analytic truths, while the widest scope yields contingent falsehoods. This distinction, like the one between discovery and verification, helps clarify our understanding of logical processes and emphasizes the importance of context in both discovery and justification.\n\nIn mathematics, I have argued that there is nothing that either ℚ (the rational numbers) or ℤ (the integers) enables us to say about the world that ℕ (the natural numbers) doesn't allow us to say [Q10]. The discovery of ℚ-arithmetic and ℤ-arithmetic were ultimately more notational than mathematical. This aligns with my view that discovery often involves finding new ways to express existing knowledge, while verification involves establishing the truth of these expressions.\n\nOverall, the distinction between discovery and verification, as maintained in System L, is a fundamental aspect of understanding logical reasoning, mathematical practice, and even artificial intelligence. Discovery involves generating new ideas and insights through inductive methods, while verification involves confirming these ideas through deductive reasoning. Although these processes are distinct, they are also interrelated and often inform each other, challenging the strict separation proposed by Popper. This interconnectedness is evident across various domains, from mathematics to semantics to AI, and underscores the complexity and richness of theoretical reasoning.\n\nIn my examination of the methods used in discovery and verification, I assert that a clear distinction exists between these processes, particularly in the context of logical and mathematical reasoning. System L, as I describe it, maintains this crucial distinction, with discovery procedures involving inductive methods to uncover new solutions or insights, and verification procedures employing deductive methods to confirm these findings [P1], [P2]. This differentiation is essential not only for understanding how new knowledge is generated but also for ensuring its validity.\n\nMathematicians, in practice, rarely rely solely on pure deduction. While deduction is critical for verification, the initial act of discovery often involves noticing patterns, drawing analogies, following intuitions, and making educated guesses [P3]. This intuitive and sometimes empirical approach does not detract from the rigor of mathematical reasoning but rather complements it by guiding mathematicians to potential solutions that can later be rigorously proved through deduction.\n\nThe insight that guides a mathematician to a theorem often comes through pattern recognition or analogy. However, this insight itself isn't the proof—it's a guide to where the proof might be found [P4]. This underscores the role of discovery as a preliminary stage in the process of mathematical reasoning, one that is distinct from but intrinsically linked to the subsequent stage of justification.\n\nI argue that the real error of psychologism lies not in the use of psychological or empirical insights in reasoning but in treating such insights as justifications rather than as tools for discovery [P5]. This distinction is critical because it acknowledges the role of psychological insights in guiding discovery while maintaining the necessity of logical and empirical proofs in the justification process.\n\nThe Prior Knowledge Principle, which I propose, states that if using a formal system requires us to already know what we're trying to find out, that system fails as a tool of discovery [P6]. This principle highlights the need for discovery methods that are genuinely capable of generating new insights, rather than merely repackaging existing knowledge. In this light, discovery methods must be evaluated on their ability to generate novel insights without presupposing prior understanding.\n\nI critique Popper's strict separation between the contexts of discovery and justification, arguing that such a separation cannot be maintained [P7]. In practice, discovery and justification are interrelated aspects of theoretical reasoning. This is evident in artificial intelligence, where discovery processes follow identifiable logical principles, incorporate domain knowledge, respect causal and explanatory constraints, and maintain internal coherence [P8]. These processes demonstrate that discovery and justification are not categorically distinct but rather are connected elements of a comprehensive reasoning framework.\n\nThe features that make a hypothesis worth considering are inherently connected to what justifies it [P9]. This connection suggests that discovery and justification are not separate stages but intertwined processes that inform and reinforce each other. This interrelation challenges the traditional view and calls for a more integrated understanding of how knowledge is developed and validated.\n\nDiscovery and justification, therefore, are not categorically distinct processes but rather interrelated aspects of theoretical reasoning [P10]. This perspective allows for a more nuanced understanding of the methods used in discovery and verification, recognizing that these processes are not isolated but mutually reinforcing components of scientific and mathematical inquiry.\n\nIn the realm of semantics, I address the distinction between 'sentences₁' (expressions with functions from contexts to propositions as meanings) and 'sentences₂' (expressions with propositions as meanings) [Q3]. I argue that introducing such a distinction would create a massive and implausible cleavage into a unified class of expressions. Instead, it is more coherent to treat all sentences uniformly as having a two-dimensional structure. This approach aligns with my broader view that discovery and justification are interconnected processes rather than distinct categories.\n\nIn the domain of indexicals, anaphora, and definite descriptions, I critique Jackson and Pettit's attempt to save externalism via \"program causes.\" Their distinction between causal efficacy and causal relevance, I argue, does not rescue the causal potency of externally individuated content [Q4]. This critique further underscores my position that discovery and justification are interrelated, as the justification of semantic theories must be informed by insights gained through the discovery of linguistic patterns and regularities.\n\nThe statement \"Hesperus might not have been Phosphorus\" is, strictly speaking, absurd because a thing cannot be other than itself [Q5]. What is not absurd, however, is a claim about our epistemic situation: the perceptions associated with \"Hesperus\" and \"Phosphorus\" could have been caused by two distinct objects. This highlights the role of discovery in challenging and refining our understanding of identity and reference, which, in turn, informs the justification of semantic theories.\n\nThe wide-scope/narrow-scope distinction explains the appearance of \"necessary a posteriori\" statements [Q6]. By giving the necessity operator narrowest scope, we yield analytic truths; by granting it the widest scope, we encounter contingent falsehoods. This distinction illustrates how discovery and justification are intertwined in semantic analysis, as the discovery of scope-dependent interpretations informs the justification of modal claims.\n\nIn exploring the analogue-digital distinction and induction, I affirm that innate knowledge exists [Q7]. This acknowledgment supports my view that discovery processes are grounded in innate cognitive structures that guide the acquisition and validation of new knowledge. These structures facilitate the discovery of patterns and regularities, which are then subject to rigorous justification through empirical and logical methods.\n\nI also consider the nature of morality and self-interest, questioning whether it is categorically in one's interest to act morally [Q8]. This inquiry highlights the interplay between discovery and justification in ethical reasoning, as the discovery of moral principles is informed by empirical observations and philosophical reflection, while their justification requires coherent ethical arguments.\n\nIn discussing the nature of happiness and morality, I draw a distinction between the recognition of knowledge as an effect and knowledge itself [Q9]. Similarly, joy and pleasure are effects of happiness and are therefore distinct from it. This distinction underscores the role of discovery in understanding the causal and relational aspects of complex concepts, which in turn informs their justification.\n\nFinally, in the field of mathematics, I argue that there is nothing that either ℚ or ℤ enables us to say about the world that ℕ doesn't allow us to say [Q10]. The discovery of ℚ-arithmetic and ℤ-arithmetic, I contend, was ultimately more notational than mathematical. This perspective reinforces my view that discovery and justification are interconnected, as the discovery of new mathematical structures must be justified through logical analysis and empirical applicability.\n\nIn conclusion, the methods used in discovery and verification are not distinct categories but rather interrelated processes that inform and reinforce each other. By maintaining a clear distinction between discovery and justification while acknowledging their interdependence, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of how knowledge is generated and validated across various domains. This integrated approach challenges traditional views and calls for a reevaluation of the role of discovery and justification in scientific and mathematical inquiry.
