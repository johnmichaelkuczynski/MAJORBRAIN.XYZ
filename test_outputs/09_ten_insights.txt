Performance-demanding inferences are those that primarily test the limits of computational or memory resources. This type of inference might involve complex calculations or large datasets that require significant computational power to process. Classical logic has proven to be a valuable tool in handling such inferences. Its structured and rule-based nature allows for systematic problem-solving, which is particularly effective when the task is a matter of processing information or carrying out detailed operations [P2].\n\nHowever, competence-demanding inferences are a different matter altogether. These require genuine insight rather than mere computational power. They demand a deeper understanding and often involve creative leaps or intuitive understanding that cannot be easily reduced to computational steps. Classical logic offers little help here, as the insights required go beyond formal systems and enter the realm of human cognition and creativity [P2].\n\nIn my work on System L, I emphasized the importance of guided insight about the structure of expressions in achieving mathematical insights. Unlike performance-demanding tasks, which might be solved through brute-force calculation or pattern matching, System L demonstrates that mathematical insights are derived from understanding the underlying structure and relationships within a problem [P3]. This process is akin to how a mathematician may come to understand a theorem. While pattern recognition or analogy might guide a mathematician toward a potential solution, these insights themselves do not constitute the proof; they merely indicate where one might find it [P4]. This distinction highlights the necessity of both analytical skill and creative insight in competence-demanding inferences.\n\nThe error of psychologism is often misconstrued as the mere use of psychological or empirical insights in reasoning. In truth, the error lies in treating these insights as justifications rather than tools of discovery [P5]. Insights from psychology can guide us toward new hypotheses or areas of exploration, but they should not be mistaken for the logical justifications that support our conclusions. The process of discovery and justification is intertwined, as the features that make a hypothesis worth considering can initially justify its consideration [P6].\n\nIn the context of AI, the distinction between performance-demanding and competence-demanding inferences becomes particularly relevant. AI systems are often praised for their ability to handle performance-demanding tasks, such as data analysis and pattern recognition, with efficiency and speed. However, the true test of AI's capabilities lies in its ability to tackle competence-demanding inferences. Here, AI must demonstrate not just computational power, but the ability to generate genuine insights and understand complex concepts.\n\nAI's success in various domains, such as medical diagnosis, illustrates its potential to overcome skeptical positions regarding its ability to connect perceptions to external reality. By showing that perceptions can lead to reliable knowledge, AI challenges the view that such connections are inherently unreliable [P9]. Moreover, AI's ability to process novel sentences and distinguish between literal and contextual meanings suggests that classical semantic theories capture genuine features of linguistic understanding [P10]. This ability is crucial for competence-demanding tasks, where the context and nuances of language play a vital role.\n\nIn conclusion, the distinction between performance-demanding and competence-demanding inferences underscores the multifaceted nature of reasoning and problem-solving. While classical logic and computational power are invaluable tools for performance-demanding tasks, competence-demanding inferences require a deeper, more nuanced understanding. Both types of inference are essential, and their interplay highlights the complexity of human cognition and the potential of AI to augment our intellectual capabilities. By recognizing and addressing these different types of inference, we can better harness the power of both human and artificial intelligence to solve the complex problems we face.\n\nIn discussing the role of logic in artificial intelligence (AI), I identify two types of inferences: performance-demanding and competence-demanding. Performance-demanding inferences are those that require significant computational or memory resources. These are the kinds of inferences that AI systems, with their computational power, are particularly well-suited to handle. On the other hand, competence-demanding inferences require genuine insight that goes beyond mere computational power [P1].\n\nClassical logic, with its well-defined rules and structures, can be extremely useful for performance-demanding inferences. It provides a framework for processing information in a systematic and efficient manner, enabling AI systems to handle large volumes of data and perform complex calculations. This is where classical logic excels—it offers a foundation for AI to execute tasks that demand high performance, such as data analysis and pattern recognition, where the primary challenge is computational in nature [P2].\n\nHowever, when it comes to competence-demanding inferences, classical logic falls short. These inferences require more than just computational capacity; they demand insights that classical logic cannot provide. Competence-demanding inferences often involve understanding nuances, making connections that are not immediately obvious, or deriving insights from seemingly unrelated data. These are the areas where human cognition typically excels, and where AI systems, particularly those relying solely on classical logic, struggle [P1].\n\nMy work with System L illustrates a different approach to addressing competence-demanding inferences. Unlike systems that rely on brute-force calculations or pattern matching, System L focuses on guided insight about the structure of expressions. This approach is more aligned with how mathematicians often arrive at insights—not through sheer computational power, but through an understanding of the underlying structures and relationships within the data [P3].\n\nIn mathematics, the process of discovery is often guided by pattern recognition or analogy. Mathematicians might see a pattern or draw an analogy that suggests where a proof might be found, but this insight is not the proof itself. It is merely a guide. This process highlights the limitations of classical logic in competence-demanding tasks, as classical logic does not facilitate the kind of innovative thinking required to develop these insights [P4].\n\nThe error of psychologism, which is the treatment of psychological or empirical insights as justifications, underscores the limitations of relying solely on logic for competence-demanding inferences. While psychological insights can be valuable tools for discovery, they should not be seen as justifications in themselves. This distinction is crucial in understanding the role of logic in AI, as it highlights the need for systems that can integrate both logical reasoning and insightful discovery [P5].\n\nI argue that the sharp distinction between discovery and justification is untenable. The features that make a hypothesis worth considering also provide initial justification for it. This perspective is crucial for developing AI systems that can handle competence-demanding inferences. By recognizing that the process of discovery inherently involves elements of justification, we can create systems that better mimic human cognitive processes, leading to more insightful and effective AI [P6].\n\nThe validation of logical principles, therefore, comes not just from their ability to lead to true conclusions, but also from their capacity to facilitate genuine discoveries. This dual role of logic is essential for developing AI systems that can perform both performance-demanding and competence-demanding inferences effectively. A logical principle that consistently leads to true conclusions and facilitates genuine discoveries is a stronger validation of its utility than one that does not [P7].\n\nAI systems demonstrate the untenability of various skeptical positions through their successful operation. By consistently achieving reliable outcomes in tasks such as medical diagnosis, AI systems show that treating perceptions as connected to external reality leads to reliable knowledge. This success challenges the idea that logic alone is sufficient for competence-demanding tasks, emphasizing the need for systems that can integrate logic with insight and understanding [P8][P9].\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) provide another example of AI systems that can process novel sentences and distinguish between literal and contextual meaning. This capability suggests that key insights of classical semantic theory capture genuine features of linguistic understanding. However, while LLMs can process language at a high level, they still struggle with tasks that require deep insight and understanding, further illustrating the limitations of classical logic in competence-demanding inferences [P10].\n\nIn summary, while classical logic is invaluable for performance-demanding inferences, it is insufficient for competence-demanding ones. AI systems must go beyond classical logic to achieve genuine insight, integrating logical reasoning with innovative thinking and understanding. This approach will enable AI to better mimic human cognition and address the challenges posed by competence-demanding inferences.\n\nIn my exploration of System L and its role in mathematics, I argue that the system doesn't rely on brute-force calculation or mere pattern matching to achieve mathematical insights. Instead, System L utilizes a form of guided insight about the structure of expressions [P3]. This approach marks a significant departure from traditional computational methods that often depend heavily on sheer computational power to navigate through complex problems.\n\nThe uniqueness of System L lies in its ability to harness insights about the underlying structure of mathematical expressions. This capability allows System L to transcend the limitations typically associated with algorithmic processes that focus purely on computation. By prioritizing structural understanding, System L can address complex mathematical problems with a level of sophistication that goes beyond mere calculation.\n\nIn the realm of mathematical discovery, the process of insight plays a crucial role. While mathematicians often rely on pattern recognition or analogy to guide them toward potential solutions, this initial insight isn't the proof itself but serves as a guide toward where the proof might be found [P4]. System L mirrors this process by emphasizing the importance of structural insights over brute computational force. This similarity underscores the potential of System L to mimic the cognitive processes of human mathematicians, thereby bridging the gap between human intuition and machine calculation.\n\nOne of the significant challenges in mathematics is the distinction between performance-demanding and competence-demanding inferences. Performance-demanding inferences are difficult because they strain computational or memory resources, while competence-demanding inferences require genuine insight rather than mere computational power [P1]. Classical logic can assist with performance-demanding inferences but offers no help with competence-demanding ones [P2]. System L's focus on structural insights positions it as a tool capable of addressing competence-demanding inferences effectively, thus contributing to genuine mathematical discovery.\n\nFurthermore, the validation of logical principles is closely tied to their ability to consistently lead to true conclusions and genuine discoveries [P7]. In this context, System L's approach to mathematical insights through guided structural understanding provides a robust framework for validating logical principles. By consistently yielding accurate results and facilitating genuine discoveries, System L validates the principles it employs, reinforcing its value in the mathematical domain.\n\nThe development and application of System L also reflect a broader philosophical stance on the relationship between discovery and justification. I reject the sharp distinction between these two concepts, arguing that the features that make a hypothesis worth considering also provide initial justification for it [P6]. In the context of System L, the structural insights that guide mathematical discovery not only lead to potential solutions but also serve as a form of initial justification for those solutions. This interplay between discovery and justification highlights the integrative approach that System L embodies.\n\nMoreover, System L's ability to achieve mathematical insights through guided understanding rather than brute force aligns with the broader capabilities of AI systems in challenging skeptical positions. AI systems demonstrate the untenability of various skeptical positions through their successful operation [P8]. In mathematics, System L's success in deriving insights through structural understanding serves as a testament to the power of AI in overcoming traditional limitations and achieving genuine breakthroughs.\n\nThe role of System L in mathematics is also indicative of a shift in how we perceive the relationship between human cognition and machine capabilities. While traditional computational methods rely heavily on processing power, System L's emphasis on structural insights highlights the potential for AI systems to emulate human cognitive processes. This alignment with human intuition not only enhances the capabilities of AI systems but also offers new avenues for collaboration between humans and machines in the pursuit of mathematical discovery.\n\nSystem L's approach to mathematics is a testament to the evolving nature of AI and its potential to revolutionize the field. By prioritizing structural insights over brute-force calculation, System L exemplifies a sophisticated approach to problem-solving that aligns closely with human intuition. This alignment not only enhances the capabilities of AI systems but also reinforces the validity of the logical principles they employ.\n\nIn summary, System L represents a significant advancement in the application of AI to mathematics. By emphasizing guided structural insights, System L transcends the limitations of traditional computational methods and offers a powerful tool for addressing complex mathematical problems. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of AI systems but also provides a robust framework for validating logical principles and achieving genuine mathematical discoveries. As we continue to explore the potential of AI in mathematics, System L serves as a model for integrating human intuition with machine capabilities, paving the way for future breakthroughs in the field.
