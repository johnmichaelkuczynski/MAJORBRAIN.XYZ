then further there is its contrary, the privation | Three Principles\",\"[P2] aristotle | In what sense these are two, and in what sense more, has been stated above | Three Principles\",\"[P3] aristotle | Briefly, we explained first that only the contraries were principles, and later that a substratum was indispensable, and that the principles were three; our last statement has elucidated the difference between the contraries, the mutual relation of the principles, and the nature of the substratum | Three Principles\",\"[P4] aristotle | Whether the form or the substratum is the essential nature of a physical object is not yet clear | Form and Substratum\",\"[P5] aristotle | But that the principles are three, and in what sense, and the way in which each is a principle, is clear | Three Principles\",\"[P6] aristotle | So much then for the question of the number and the nature of the principles | Three Principles\",\"[P7] aristotle | We will now proceed to show that the difficulty of the early thinkers, as well as our own, is solved in this way alone | Critique of Early Thinkers\",\"[P8] aristotle | The first of those who studied science were misled in their search for truth and the nature of things by their inexperience, which as it were thrust them into another path | Critique of Early Thinkers\",\"[P9] aristotle | So they say that none of the things that are either comes to be or passes out of existence, because what comes to be must do so either from what is or from what is not, both of which are impossible | Coming-to-be and Passing Away\",\"[P10] aristotle | Our explanation on the other hand is that the phrases 'something comes to be from what is or from what is not', 'what is not or what is does something or has something done to it or becomes some particular thing', are to be taken in the same sense as 'a doctor does something or has something done to him', 'is or becomes something from being a doctor' | Coming-to-be and Passing Away\",\"[P11] aristotle | Matter is nearly, in a sense is, substance, while the privation in no sense is | Matter and Privation\",\"[P12] aristotle | They, on the other hand, identify their Great and Small alike with not being, and that whether they are taken together as one or separately | Critique of Platonists\",\"[P13] aristotle | Their triad is therefore of quite a different kind from ours | Critique of Platonists\",\"[P14] aristotle | For they got so far as to see that there must be some underlying nature, but they make it one—for even if one philosopher makes a dyad of it, which he calls Great and Small, the effect is the same, for he overlooked the other nature | Critique of Platonists\",\"[P15] aristotle | For the one which persists is a joint cause, with the form, of what comes to be—a mother, as it were | Matter and Causation\",\"[P16] aristotle | But the negative part of the contrariety may often seem, if you concentrate your attention on it as an evil agent, not to exist at all | Matter and Privation\",\"[P17] aristotle | For admitting with them that there is something divine, good, and desirable, we hold that there are two other principles, the one contrary to it, the other such as of its own nature to desire and yearn for it | Three Principles\",\"[P18] aristotle | The truth is that what desires the form is matter, as the female desires the male and the ugly the beautiful—only the ugly or the female not per se but per accidens | Matter's Desire for Form\",\"[P19] aristotle | The matter comes to be and ceases to be in one sense, while in another it does not | Matter and Change\",\"[P20] aristotle | As that which contains the privation, it ceases to be in its own nature, for what ceases to be—the privation—is contained within it | Matter and Privation\"],\"quotes\":[\"[Q1] \\\"aristotle | To go to the judge is to go to justice | Nicomachean Ethics\\\"\",\"[Q2] \\\"aristotle | The judge is so to speak justice personified | Nicomachean Ethics\\\"\",\"[Q3] \\\"aristotle | Justice is a mean because the judge is a mediator | Nicomachean Ethics\\\"\",\"[Q4] \\\"aristotle | The just is a species of the proportionate | Nicomachean Ethics\\\"\",\"[Q5] \\\"aristotle | Proportion is a mean, and the just is proportional | Nicomachean Ethics\\\"\",\"[Q6] \\\"aristotle | The just in transactions is a kind of equal | Nicomachean Ethics\\\"\",\"[Q7] \\\"aristotle | The unjust a kind of unequal | Nicomachean Ethics\\\"\",\"[Q8] \\\"aristotle | This kind of friendship is permanent, as we might expect | Nicomachean Ethics\\\"\",\"[Q9] \\\"aristotle | Man is a political animal | Politics\\\"\",\"[Q10] \\\"aristotle | God is pure actuality (energeia) with no potentiality whatsoever | Theology / The Nature of God\\\"\",\"[Q11] \\\"aristotle | Motion (kinesis) is the actuality of potentiality qua potentiality | Physics\\\"\",\"[Q12] \\\"aristotle | Desire (orexis) is the efficient cause of animal locomotion | Psychology\\\"\",\"[Q13] \\\"# ARISTOTLE POSITIONS DATABASE\\\"\",\"[Q14] \\\"# Format: thinker | statement | topic\\\"\",\"[Q15] \\\"## I.
